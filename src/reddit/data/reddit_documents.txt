It is astounding he would countenance the settlement payment of $32 million for sexual wrong doing accusations then be outraged at the career price he is required to pay. Who pays such gross amounts when you feign utter innocence?You could pay a hooker to suck your dick every single minute from now until the day you died for that much money (I did the math), but O'Reilly prefers to spend it on getting shamefully rejected by women he works with while he jerks off.Think about the implication of that.  It's not the sex that makes it worth it for him, it's being a piece of shit.  That's what you can't buy from a prostitute is their misery.  You can't ruin their careers, you can't make them cry, you can't hurt their marriages and make them give up on their dreams.That's why this is worth so much to him.  He's got to be destroying people's careers and ruining their lives to get his shriveled old dick off like a serial killer who can't get hard unless he's torturing someone. Funny you shouls mention serial killing, since [Bill actually wrote a novel about a TV journalist who loses his job due to sex assault allegations and proceeds to murder his coworkers.](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/reading-bill-oreillys-old-novel-about-a-tv-newsman-who-murders-several-people-after-losing-his-job)I'm not saying that Bill O'Reilly is a psychopath and a potential risk to society and those physically close to him.No way.Hm. Interesting analysis. Not sure I agree with every point but overall I think you're on to something.Power dynamics is probably a huge component to it. to him its about power, not sex.And the power he gets off on can only be realized by destroying something.  He can't get off to positive power - like helping someone unfortunate, or mentoring someone, or protecting someone weak from danger.  Those are ways to feel powerful that help those around you.He can only get off to negative power.   He has to see pain, suffering, fear.  Someone has to be made lower for him to feel higher.So you're saying you can destroy him by trapping him in a painting and positive sliming him?Someone needs to photo shop his face onto that portrait.Glad I'm not involved in that one. No, LSD. He was saying LSD.&gt; He can't get off to positive power - like helping someone unfortunate, or mentoring someone, or protecting someone weak from danger. These are my sexual fetishes.Oh yeah you dirty slut, take my jacket when its cold outside. Awww yeah...fucking live up to your potential, live it alllll uppp...Yeah that's right, make a positive change in your life like the little whore you are. My pillow talk could use work. It's pretty weird to get off sexually directly from protecting people. Is it?  That's like the oldest story plot in the book.  Save the princess and make the hanky-pankey.Yeah but the prince isn't getting a boner FROM saving the princess. He loves her but when he is fighting the dragon/climbing the tower he doesn't have a chub at full mast. The situation itself doesn't get the prince off. Lets make more contemporary, imagine if man went to feed the homeless because every time he gives out a sandwich he got harder, that be really weird. Don't judge me broKink shaming is my kink, dont judge ME. I dunno, I've never fought a dragon, maybe the best way to do is it naked with a massive erection?Sounds like a fetish you only get to live out once. &gt;imagine if man went to feed the homeless because every time he gives out a sandwich he got harder, that be really weird.To paraphrase Patton Oswalt, I don't care why people do good things, even if it's the most rediculous thing I've ever heard of.You know nothing of dragons. The only thing they fear is a proud boner.It's called righteousness and humanity already had a dark age because someone thought that you could save lives by killing.You can save lives by killing. "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."Everything is about sex. Except sex, that is about power. -Oscar WildeBut that was butt sex and fighting about which man would be on topI thought m-mister Underwood said thatAs is with most rapistsIronically that's how it is for rapists too. Coincidentally, not ironically.I'd argue that most if not all rapists get off way more on power than the actual sex.Some might say well of course rape is about sex?? Yes, but it's more like the carnal urge and the show of masculinity that gives and the rapist gets the climax which is like a positive reinforcement.If it was about having sex with a hot girl, or the girl you desire, they would just hire an attractive escort or put alot of effort into that girl like a lot of other guys do. Because they enjoy having sex with that person.Rape is different, rape is getting off on the fact that you can make that hot girl/guy or even worse a child submit to you. It's humiliating, and makes the other person feel shameful and powerless, it's not about enjoying a sexual experience with a person who is attracted to you. Of course it's way more complex than can be fit into a reddit comment.. Exactly. The mere fact that he could afford the highest class prostitutes there are proves that.Yeah, a lot of people don't seem to understand the pathological nature of these men. They are not just horny dudes, they are broken humans getting off on disgust and control.All these high power alpha males pathetically beating off into plants, dry humping, cumming in their pants, begging women for sex. It would be funnier if it wasn't so horrifying and sad. Psychopaths, often having very well paying jobs. Sadly also adored by too many people. Money doesn't defines a character, it often destroys him.It's products of our culture: money above all. I totally agree, but I think it's time to question the status quo. Right. He could have sex with willing partners, no problem. But what he wants is to force the unwilling to succumb to his disgustingness. He must overcome her objection to objectify her. If he forces her to give into his totally obscene and unattractive needs, he has suspended or undermined her true power of choice, or freedom, that is, he wants to create a powerless unwilling recipient of his perverse desires. Partially he does this so that he does not have to worry about her opinion of his performance, or adequacy. The main story of the drama is that she didn't like it because he forced her, not because he himself is just unattractive or weak sexually. He can avoid his own confrontation with his own disgust in himself. &gt; You could pay a hooker to suck your dick every single minute from now until the day you died for that much money (I did the math)Assuming Bill O'Reilly planned to live another 20 years (he's 68), that works out to $3.02/minute, or $181/hour ([Wolfram Alpha link](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=$32+million+%2F+20+years+in+$%2Fminute)). It only just occurred to me that I've never paid anyone for sex, but this seems like a perfectly reasonable BJ rate.&gt; I've never paid anyone for sex, but this seems like a perfectly reasonable BJ rate.Ask Wolfram Alpha...? Edit: Now, I'm curious. Please ask it.[It doesn't seem to know. ](http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=how+much+does+a+blowjob+from+a+prostitute+cost%3F)I tried several different ways of wording it. Anyone's free to try to show me up though. There are several factors here that would require a bit more money:The girls would have to do 30 to 60 minute shifts. I mean we are talking *continuous* BJs, that means no water, no pausing for cramps. This means we have to have 24 to 48 hookers per day, which would involve three shifts of pimps to organize all the comings and goings; or you have to have a smaller group that you rotate through that hang out nearby, which would involve on-call compensation and per diem, among other expenses.Assuming Bill wants to carry on with a normal retired lifestyle (continuous BJs are a bit hard to reconcile with staying on at Fox), then these BJs have to occur in all kinds of awkward circumstances: blumpkins, traveling, public settings, while walking (maybe a Rascal will have to be involved). The extra hazard pay, logistics and equipment involved here will definitely up the rate.Ballpark, I'd say it would cost at least $360 an hour, so he only gets about 10 years of continuous BJs for that payout.Huh, seems almost not even worth it. And that's assuming he lives another 20 years. The average lifespan is 75 so with only roughly 7 years left he could either triple the rate or maybe get a group deal. One to suck his dick, one to tickle his balls etc. And that's 24/7/365 even when he's sleeping, even on holidays. There must've been some seriously damaging info on this guy for him to pay 32 million.&gt; The average lifespan is 75The life expectancy of a male who was just born is 75 (I think it's closer to 79 these days)The life expectancy of someone like Bill who is 68 is 15 years. [Source.](http://life-span.healthgrove.com/l/69/68)If you don't understand the difference, think of it this way: You are a lot more likely to finish a marathon if you've already run most of it than you are if you are just starting.I'm in the wrong career./r/theydidthemath 3 hours and I think we're safe.**SO DON'T ANYONE FUCKING SAY IT!**/r/theydidthemonstermathSIGH. This is why we can't have nice things. :PYou've definitely got a great point there and I myself think that in addition to everything you've said. That he is a misogynist against women who leave the kitchen.  I doubt O'Reilly looks at any woman in the world and see's themselves as equal to him, but he would see another man with the same status as him as equal. &gt; Think about the implication of that. It's not the sex that makes it worth it for him, it's being a piece of shit.That's a pretty massive reach.The more obvious conclusion is that he doesn't want to hire prostitutes for the remainder of his life and would rather have sexual relations with people whom he has at least some other connection with (e.g. social or professional).Please show your calculations.20 years to live, that's 175,000 hours.  $200/hour puts you right at $35M on the button.Let's be honest though, the man has to sleep and eat and such. Obviously he can eat, read the paper, take showers, etc etc while getting sucked off, but sleeping through a BJ (even one that's been doing on since 6am) is going to be downright impossible. So let's say he's doing 6 hours of sleep a night, unfellated. So at 18 hours of knob slobbin', he's actually able to afford about $243.50/hour. That may not seem huge, but that's the difference between the C squad and the B squad probably. Now, given that these men/women are going to essentially employed full time suckin' this old man's dick day in and day out, it's probably wise to get them gainfully employed. I think the most reliable data says you are looking at around 2.75 x base salary for the actual cost of employment. This puts us in the neighborhood of $85 an hour. I shaved off a few bucks since there will probably be some admin expenses related to managing the whole work'in-it force.So basically, Bill O'Reilly could provide jobs for like 3 full time employees and a part timer...WITH BENEFITS...if he'd just fuck the fuck off and let prostitutes suck his dick for the rest of his life. 20 years of that and you are helping send some kids to college, people buy homes, set up for retirement, etc etc. Bill O'Reilly could literally save a dozen people's lives if he'd just stop being an asshole for a minute and let some people suck his dick for the next two decades.You want jobs and economic growth, Bill? Get sucked.I give you an 8/10 since you didn't account for leap years...Dude, you nailed it. This is what a lot of people are saying about Weinstein... it was the power, humiliation and shame that drove him. So gross. In other words, power. Specifically the power to ruin others.that's possible, but the reality is that most of the time people think other people are hot and take it too far and harass/assault them. most people never consider a prostitute (especially if you are a well known public figure I demand to see this “math” of yours.What would the rate for the hookers be? Does this account for his old man refractory period? Does he sleep in the theorem? Does he get blown while dropping one? These are the questions we need to answer when making these bold claims. Seriously not serious. I think that sums it up pretty well.I think when I grow up I want to be rich enough to pay a hooker to suck my dick every single minute  until the day I die. This guy fucks.Adam carolla was basically saying this.  It's spot on.  He could have paid for sex every day and saved money.   But that's not what he wants.  He wants to be a piece of shit.  That's what makes him happy. More like... It worked enough times outa ten that he could justify the odds.Well, he blamed god.dick goes in, money goes out.... can't explain thatI feel like you can't be the first person to come up with this, but it's the first time I see it, and I laughed my ass off.Bill O'Reilly seems far less concerned with his dick going into things, and far more concerned with things going up his own asshole.To be fair, if there is a god, everything is kinda god's fault. Even then,"No Bill, you're not wrong - you're just an asshole!"[deleted]god shouldn't have given O'Reilly free will apparently... if you let your pet off the leash, that's on you.Eh, only if it also has the divine attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, omnitemporality, and omnipresence. The same man that asked where other people's - some *entire communities of people* where their personal accountability was...blamed GOD for his sexual harrassment allegations.True life is the new satire.Well to be fair *AFTER* he paid the 32 million settlement for sexual wrong doing, FOX NEWS gave him a $100 million contract... so he's used to it being no big deal.If the president can do it why can't a fox news host?It's almost a requirement.He's also said he has hardcore evidence to prove his innocence but won't let his children have to see a long year or two court case. As if paying 32 million and not clearing your name is so much better.The same kids who saw him shoves his wife's head through the wall and drag her down the stairs? Those kids?Because he understands that Americans will forget all about it in a week or two and move on to another enemy. But in a few weeks or months, people will forget all about the $32 million settlement and say: "Well, there were no charges and he says he was innocent... so he must be right!"I don't know about you but if I paid 32 million for rape accusations I totally raped them.... I raped them 32 million worth..Bill is a colossal jackass, what is why.Apparently he’s very angry with God about the whole situation.Not since Job has their been a greater injustice in this world.According to him, he paid it so that they would shut up about it.  He doesn't want it affecting his kids.  He doesn't want people telling his kids that he's always due in court to defend against this sex scandal.  Instead he now has to live with his kids being bullied for having a father who for sure is a sexual deviant.  He's an idiot, that's why he paid 32 mil.I think that is why he countenanced the payment.  He feels jipped.....and he has a point...But it is still justice. O'Reilly recently told an interviewer that the reason he paid all of these settlements, including the most recent $32 million, was because he said the tabloids would attack his children. Fucking piece of shit, using his children as an excuse for his lecherous bullshit. This is was is pissing me off the most.  NOBODY is talking about his kids but him. He uses them as a shield and brings them up in every interview and tries to appropriate violent actions to other people when NOBODY in the world gives a fuck about or talks about his kids.  He is such a fucking coward.   Not to mention his own kids don't like him.  In 2016 Oreilly lost all custody of his kids because his kids clearly stated to the judge they don't want to live with him.  Oreilly's daughter testified to see Oreilly drag their mother down some steps by her neck. The guy is a real piece of shit. That, and in the interview I read he was still trying to come off like his usual tough guy persona. Tough guys don't hide behind their kids, and real men take responsibility for their actions. He has no honor. He's a whiny bitch whose only redeeming quality is when he meets his intellectual equal he backs down and admits defeat, or at least tries to play nice to keep from looking the fool. Remember when Fox news went crazy over Trump's grandkids?Wait, the children who he lost in the divorce to the wife he dragged down the stairs, the children who reportedly hate him and refuse to have any contact with him?Those children?Those children. O'Reilly is a piece of shit. This only makes me want to attack his children more!&gt; $32 million settlement paid to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. That's some big money being paid by this "innocent" gentleman.Who apparently has all the evidences to prove his innocence, but chose not to. The same man who talked so much about personal accountability of others turned and said he's "mad at god over these sexual harrassment allegations".My guy, take some personal responsibility. Where are the parents? Does he really have talent?  Anybody can sit behind a camera and throw poorly crafted insults at people they disagree with. Bill O'Reilly goes in and Bill O'Reilly goes out. You can't explain that! It doesn't sound like he ever went in. Plus as part of the settlement the woman had to read off a piece of paper that said that he never did anything wrong. That's how you know what kind of person he is. He was let go from the racist bigot channel for being too bigoted.I was making a joke about when he said ["tide goes, tide goes out, you can't explain that."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzkRHFl2ppw)You forgot to put 'out' in your first comment and it ruined everything.&gt;Does he really have talent?  You can't explain that&gt;Anybody can sit behind a camera and throw poorly crafted insults at people they disagree with.Not really. You have to sort of lack a conscience to get on TV and lie to people on a nightly basis, to spew so much hateful rhetoric, etc. Most people honestly aren't cut out for it.I have told this story on reddit before but in any case. I used to drive uber sat nights and would always start my night by this one bar that a ton of the fox news people went to. It was a good place to start a night. Had a lot of long drives with these people very drunk and eager to tell me about their job. Met some of the on air and off air talent. One question I would always ask was if people like hannity and bill really believe what they say on TV. Without exception they said yes and even to the point that hannity will argue with support staff about politics with cameras off.You take this for what is worth. I personally believe it. These people do hours of on screen work per night I find it hard to believe they could keep a lie going that long and with that amount of passion.Plus he got people fired up to agree with him. Saying anyone can do this is like saying anyone can be Hitler. Hitler had no real military skill. He had no real political skill. What he had was clout, like our president does. He had a book out. And he had boat loads of charisma. Did people disagree with him? Of course they did. Some people had to see what a piece of crap he was. But he got the mob fired up to take over. That is a skill.But can you do it fucking live? You film it and he'll fucking write it! Fucking shit sucks!I can't stand O'Reilly but you can't deny he is talented. He was the number one show on cable news for a long time. That's pretty tough to do. I never liked his show, but obviously a lot of people did.Yes, he knew exactly how to appeal to his audience.Whatever he was doing he was doing right. He had the highest ratings on TV for his genre. I’ll never forget the time Donahue put Billy boy in his place though. https://youtu.be/cU-XN5kuoKEBut can you do it in a way that gains lots of supporters? It's cookie cutter branding. The Kardashians are very rich from it. Pretty much all media personalities. I don't like the guy but you have to acknowledge he has a high level of education and he *is* capable of being a good interviewer, he has at times asked very good questions or conducted good interviews and that is not an easy talent to learn. He isn't the most talented guy out there, but don't sell short the talent that being a good news anchor or pundit takes.News anchors deliver news, he delivered opinions.Whoa whoa whoa. He yells over their arguments as wellI wish this happened 10 years ago. He just happened to be in the area and saw their light was on. "Hey y'all got any more o' that talent? Sure could use a little extra."Bill O'Reilly? Talent?TALENT?BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! WAAAAY too funny!Wait, you're serious?As far as Conservative personalities go, he is considered talented. The hate must appear natural and organic."Did he just call himself the talent?"Let me laugh even harder! HAAAAAAA HAAAA HAAA HAAAAAAA!Can Bill O'Reilly just do us all a favor and drop dead already so we can stop hearing about him? Somewhere Joe Paterno is shaking his head and commenting that it doesn't work that way. Nah, let him live a long life, he deserves to lose every last cent in litigation and live his last year's broke and in obscurity. Totally inappropriate to use the words "O'Reilly" and "talent" in the same sentence.This is (or was) his publisher. Looks like "killing" series got canned with that.Looks like we won't get "killing O'Reilly" anytime soon.This was his talent agency not his publisher that canned him. Henry Holt is his publisher. Read the articleWhy does a news reporter need a talent agency?News reporter. LOL, thanks, I needed that.Hilarious, but then the reality set in that some people do in fact see him as a news reporter. This is why we're fucked.Because he is/was not a news reporter. He was the host of a "news entertainment" show and a writer. Because he's not a reporter, he just played one on tv.Where else is he going to find talent?He wasn't a news reporter, he was a commentator. It's like an op-ed writer on TV, but without the fact checking.Fox doesn't do field journalism. Their presenters are closer to pundits. News Product TMSome on-air positions (think network or top 35 local market jobs, not Helena, MT News 5) are unavailable, or at the very least extremely difficult to get, unless you have representation.I'm shocked that anyone would read his books, much less pay for them. What a world.bible beltThe Inside Edition guy who yells?  Yeah, that takes major talent.Fuck it, do it live.The guy is so worried about what this is all going to do to his family that he mentions them and throws them in at every given opportunity. What talent?LMFAO! He's mad at God!He has talent?Well, I for one will be waiting for Bill's new book - *Killing O'Reilly's 'Talent' &amp; Fortune: The Two-For-One Combo*.More like BBQ O'Reilly, right? Cuz he's fired! He doesn't need a talent agency, hosts and probably will again host a millions of dollars show, and he has mutiple millions of dollars best selling books. Someone will pick him up if he feels he needs one. Agents get 15%.May he spend the rest of his life unemployed and on government assistance.Don't you have to have talent first to be dropped by a fucking talent agency?I mean he's a great actor don't get me wrong, anybody who can spew 20 lines of bullshit in under 80 seconds the way he does deserves a top spot at least on the Onion.It's pretty ironic (if that's the right word) that the agency stuck by him through all the allegations but as soon as the Weinstein scandal broke, they drop him. Jeez it's almost like he doesn't have talent. quite the assumption he had talentYet another right wing sex offender.If you're not equally mad at Weinstein, you need to take a hard look at yourself. This isn't about politics, it's about sexual predators. They come from all walks of life. I'm a liberal, before you get all bunched up about what I said. Weinstein the political pundit talking head who has a great deal of clout with his party?For a moment I thought you were talking about the apolitical businessman.Bad people come from all walks of life.  I wish we as a species could understand that.  We are. But I don't see Weinstein being brought up anywhere. This is about Bill O Reilly.That's such a pointless thing to say. Right wingers don't believe in equality for women, so it's expected.?? according to who?  If you're actually going to make this a left and right sort of argument, then you realize that the left supports islam which is one of the most oppressive religions in the world, especially towards women.  Am I the only person who read the headline and thought, "Why is it news that he visited unannounced?...Ohhhhh."Oh really?No, O'Reilly.He will be doing SyFy original movies now. He’s right, there is a godImagine waking up and being Bill O'Reilly. A living nightmare.You know things are bad when the real life Ari Gold drops you...What.is.he.hiding? O.j. Killed two people and his civil settlement was lessNom nom nom. Delicious.
&gt;It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole. The email that disclosed the server wipe said the state attorney general’s office was “reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image.”Wiping out your primary *and* the backups is very suspicious. Its a good thing the FBI made a copy earlier when they first suspected that something was up.No, wiping your primary is suspicious. Wiping your backups is blatantly trying to hide something.Also, I'm curious if anyone is gonna get charged with obstruction of justice or spoliation of evidence over this.The article doesn't really make it sound like that's gonna happen:&gt; J.Tom Morgan, a former Georgia prosecutor, said destruction of the drive would not be a criminal act unless it was in violation of a protective court order (It appears no such order was requested)So a blanket court order should be submitted for all election data in all States at this point.

From ARS TechnicaUPDATE 4:57 PM ET: Marilyn Marks, the executive director of the Coalition, a group that is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, told Ars that she had issued a litigation hold notice to the defendants."They know that they are required to preserve all records when they are sued," she e-mailed. "They don’t need court order. Even IF the SOS office didn’t have 3 dozen attorneys to tell them to preserve the records, they got this attached letter from us on July 10 and destroyed the second server hard drive on August 9.""Hey look, a technicality!

If they had data retention policies in place, it would make sense. It is very common to have policies that say "retain data for 456 days then delete" or whatever... the time dictated by legal. Data is deleted from both primary and backup servers.Deleting it the day after a lawsuit is filed? That's unlikely. The only way that would make sense is if those filing the lawsuit were doing it on that date because they knew the legal retention requirement was running out soon. But filing the day before didn't give them enough time for the request to filter to the DB admins. But yea, it's more likely they did this on purpose.

There's a bit in *Halt and Catch Fire* where someone sets up a seemingly accidental power surge issue to intentionally wipe some disks.It depends on how long ago this story happened.Back when floppy disks were still new (late 70s, early 80s) there were a lot of people who had *no fucking clue* what to do with them.  Even the language we use to describe basic functions like Copy and Paste weren't always common knowledgeComputers weren't always something we could take for granted and just assume people knew what to do.Kind of scary to wonder what new technology in my life time will eventually leave me this helpless and out of touch in old age.Doesn't have to happen. My grandpa died a few years ago at the age of 87 still able to talk your ear off about how vastly superior Linux was to Windows.Your grandfather is a wise man.Back in the old days, we tied our processes to threads with a good old needle and string. Mothballs are all we needed to keep the bugs away. Windows? We only used them for air and  light.Ohhh the files are INSIDE the computer...*inside the computer.....it's so simple*Did you take note of the dates each of those things happened?Initial server wipe - July 7thTwo seperate backup servers wiped - August 9thYeah... tell me how that was an accident, lol I'll make some popcorn.Right, and the separate backups were wiped...gasp...after the case was promoted to a federal court.&gt; The article notes that the FBI made an image of the server, and they're trying to find out if they still have it.I'm glad. As soon as I read the headline, after the initial "Holy shit" I thought "There's ways to recover data; I hope they can do that here."And sounds like it's time to introduce a federal law mandating that states maintain election data for a reasonable amount of time.They're not following current laws, what makes you think they'll follow the new ones?Why would they make an image of the server and then *not* have it?I can think of a lot of reasons, and they all have faces of dead presidentsEDIT: I get it, Ben Franklin was never a president, fuck you guys too &gt;:PDamn Sons of the Patriots. Psycho Mantis??you're that ninja....I prefer the image of a dead inventor to the dead presidents. He's worth more. 😁Storage space?&gt; Did you get to the part about how the backups were also "mysteriously wiped" right after the suit went to a federal court?Situations like that should mean an automatic vote repeat. I bet the relevant regulations will catch up in a decade or ten.For some reason the people in power are rarely in a hurry to write laws that limit their power. Weird.Like, with a cloth?It's been a few years since I took e-discovery, but from what I remember, that will likely result in an adverse inference jury instruction, so what was actually on those servers might have been worse for the defense than an adverse inference sanction. Hmm..The FBI imaged the system earlier in the year. Whoever made the call to zero out the drive better hope the FBI doesn't still have that image. There must be some incriminating shit on that system for them to make this call.If evidence is destroyed once a suit is filed, courts generally presume the evidence was not favor of the party who destroyed the evidence. Someone says, "You breached my contract," and the other party rips up the contract and says, "What contract?" The court will say, "Yep, you breached the contract."In this case, it is likely also a Felony, as destruction fo evidence during a Federal Investigation is a *BIG* No-no.Frankly, it should be a felony to ever wipe election data.  That shit should be archived forever.  Hard drives are cheap, they don't need to be reused.Right? Looks like someone in Georgia is guilty as fuck.Even if they weren't the court should apply spoliation which allows the jury/ judge depending on trial type to assume whatever is missing was detrimental to the party that lost it.Yeah but the party that lost it will be governor next year.That’s good but doesn’t let them speculate as to what was actually on it, right?Presumably the plaintiff's attorney (a) proposed as many non frivolous claims as reasonable to begin with and/or (b) will seek to amend the complaint to create those lines of thinking. It will also largely depend on what other evidence is available. Simplified, it works like this:Plaintiff/prosecutor: Our theory of the case is ABC and we think the evidence on the server data will show XYZ.Defendant: No it doesn't! And we deleted it, so no one can say for sure!Judge: jury, you may now assume that if we had the server data, it would demonstrate XYZ. Simplified a bit, but basically the speculation turns into an inference, which is quite favorable to the party who didn't wipe the server.Didn't you hear? No one is held accountable for shit in 2017.As long as they're rich, or acting in submissive obedience to the rich, this is correct.I'm distressed that I read your comment and agreed instantly and fully.You can be sure Jeff Sessions will be all over this at DOJ and Trey Gowdy won't be sleeping for the next year. /sNo one in power* is held responsible for their shit, excluding very rare outliers like Bernie Madoff. Bernie Madoff stole from other rich people."We got him!"- John Oliver"Nothing matters anymore." - Michael Che&gt; Wiping the server clean “forestalls any forensic investigation at all,” said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has closely followed the case. “People who have nothing to hide don’t behave this way.”Oops...  I didn't _mean_ to type _rm -rf /_[deleted]Oops... I didn't mean to type dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1MOops, I must've accidentally pushed the 'deploy thermite' buttonCheck out the defcon video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bpX8YvNg6YThermite didn't work so well.  Also, wicked video to watchAh see there's your problem. If thermite "didn't work so well" they just didn't use enough. More thermite is always the solution. Didn't watch the video, but I'm 99% sure your assessment is spot-on.Honestly, I'm not really a fan of physical destruction as it is often done poorly and I'd rather see data simply be deleted properly and have the disk donated.However, if you're really willing to resort to thermite then that drive shouldn't be anything more than a uniform lump of metal when you're done.  What is the point in having to safely contain a thermite fire and then not actually completely destroying the drive?I am currently watching the video, and 3 minutes in he sets up the rules:* This is for data centers, so the goal is to destroy a 1U server in a rack.* You are allowed to use 1U extra space above and below the server* The destruction needs to be completed in 60 seconds* Don't set off fire systems or seismic sensors* Contain the damage within the equipment (3U total, as you recall)* And finally, don't kill innocent bystandersWithin those restrictions, it becomes much more obvious why thermite don't work: Using enough to do the job apparently violates the safety, containment and safety rules.Anywho, I'm off to watch the rest of the video and see if they did come up with something that actually did the job within those restrictions."If brute force doesn't work, you obviously aren't using enough of it."*Someone on the internet told me it would make the computer run faster...*I totally watched that unfold on my step cousin on the EverQuest forums back in the day. He had posted asking for help with an error he was getting, and then someone gave him instructions to delete the good ole system32 folder, step by step....And the next post was from my step cousin screaming that his computer no longer worked.Someone recognized his character from his user name... That's what you get for training the zone while I was AFK!&gt;trainingOh EverQuest, you are the reson most MMOs now have a 'leash' distance for NPCs.Hey Karnor's isn't the Holiday inn, gtfo the zone line if you don't want an interview with Gorenaire! And from the sound of it, done in such a way as to make it non-recoverable, which does't just happen because someone fucked up.That's the biggest indicator of guilt for sure. Actually permanently deleting files is premeditated; it takes way more work than clearing your recycling bin. You can't  just permanently delete shit by accident.Isn't this destruction of evidence?  Someone needs to go to jail for this alone.Yeah, its called spoliation. When evidence is destroyed in the face of a trial, there are a lot of ways the judge can respond. First, they could just give a presumption that the evidence was indicative of guilt (b/c normal people don't delete this stuff). Second, they could hold the facts as established (i.e. jury can't even consider other evidence on the topic of the computer being incriminating). Third, and for egregious cases--for example, DuPont dumping boxes of evidence into the Pacific ocean--the judge can give a default judgment against the spoilating party. I bet the defense attorneys are furious at their clients right now. Unless they can show that this was simple negligence, they're probably in trouble. Also deleting backups moves it away from any "simple" negligenceWhat if evidence is destroyed/deleted before the trial?[see this case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubulake_v._UBS_Warburg)Basically the judge can allow a jury to infer that the destroyed evidence was going to be damning. Called an adverse inference instruction.No, it's not. *whistles tunelessly as eyes randomly search the ceiling*It's such a cartoonishly obvious red flag that either the people involved are incredibly stupid, or know that there are others "above" them who will make sure they get away with it. I'm going with the latter.They aren't necessarily stupid. If the information they wiped was worse than people can imagine then they absolutely did the smart move. We just know they're guilty, we don't know what they did or how bad it was. These people will surely get in trouble, but it may be far less trouble than they would be in if the data on those servers had been seized.This is most definitely true and scary. They weighed their options. That fact that they are cool with getting in trouble for wiping the data means they know they would have gotten in worse trouble if they hadn't. But we can't prove it, which is exactly what they want.&gt; The Kennesaw election center answers to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican who is running for governor in 2018 and is the main defendant in the suit.It's ran by a republican who wants to be governor.  So naturally he'll get that promotion he's fighting for despite this commotion, because that's what the party and its voters do.You know who the previous secretary of state of Georgia was? Karen Handel the woman who won the election. She hasn't held the seat since 2010, but still she definitely knows Kemp. "So um, where do you want this big delivery of magnets?"Ummm....Just put it on top of that server over there.“Just a little more on the right”“Just a little more on the left”“Just a little more on the right”“Just a little more on the left”Actually, can I refuse the delivery? I don’t think we need them anymore Ah, I see what you did there.. you think you're sooo smart! Joke is on you, I took a [snapshot of the server](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/import/switchboard/blogs/pdelforge/assets_c/2012/09/SETI_at_Home_Flickr_web_small-thumb-300x448-8047.jpg) first!Dammit... That is not how server snapshots work!And stop using white out on the screen, the keyboard has a backspace key for a reason. Over their whatI see what happened hereNow I'm just picturing that scene from Breaking Bad.https://youtu.be/JDQOvzFetxsElectronic voting is great for some things, well mostly for faster counting, but problems like this or vulnerability to hacking make it obvious to me that we can't rely on it like we are now. There should be a law requiring physical records to be kept.      I'm surprised there isn't such a law already...actually our politicians are mostly terrible so maybe 'surprised' is the wrong word.the way we do it in michigan is you fill in a bubble, and then a machine counts it. the paper ballots are still filed and kept, but he machines just count the votes. if a recount is needed, the paper ballots are there. I'm from Michigan. We had punch cards at my previous polling station and scan-tron type card where I am now (like what you're describing). Unfortunately my precinct just sent out a letter informing us that they've replaced the scan-tron type with new electronic voting machines. I know some of those machines are set up to produce a duplicate paper 'receipt' so there's a physical record, but I'm not sure if that's going to happen where I vote...I guess I'll find out.      I wont be happy without a physical record duplicate.Paper ballot can be fast counted by computer. Cash counter machines are pretty fucking fast. They can be adopted to count ballot by the thousands in minutes. true, at my polling place they use a scan-tron system...well actually, I'm told they switched those out for electronic machines after the last election so...awesome. Mine had a mix of both. Use a terminal to vote which supplies a scantron which you deposit into a safe that also take a digital copy of it so you have 2 different copies.I'm hoping that's what our new system is like. Electronic machines are fine with me as long as there's a physical record to go along with the digital one.At my polling place they use a machine and before you leave it asks you to certify your votes. When you certify your vote it prints a paper copy so there is both an electronic and a paper record of your vote. As you certify your vote you can see the paper copy that is printed with your selection. In the event that the electronic copy is wiped out someone could consult the paper copy.We count about 18 million paper votes by hand in about 6 hours here in CanadaAs a Canadian, I'll always argue against electronic voting machines. Too many questions and far too few answers. Too easy to stack against the electorate with too many easy ways to cover tracks. No brainer. Electronic voting takes committing fraud from a job that must include hundreds of people who might talk down to just a handful as well.Security professionals have been screaming about how insecure electronic voting is for nearly 20 years, but it hasn't seemed to slow the adoption of the system one iota. Which tells me that some people very badly want these systems in place for reasons that aren't entirely transparent.*From what I can tell* Estonia seems to be handling e-voting just fine. That said, they also have a system much better suited for it than us. We have a tendency to put into place systems that are already old and then leave them there until something happens and there's mass outrage, *then* we replace it with a slightly less out-dated system. There are surely secure systems out there. I mean, we've had online banking for years and years now, and even consumer-level pocket devices the FBI laments not being able to crack open. There has been plenty of talk about how the electronic systems in place in the US could be modified and hardened and audited securely to prevent tampering, but every election, I still see stories like this that make you ask, "Why is there no audit trail or backup or data to reconstruct the results?"It's about the money. Banks have it to protect themselves. State governments, not so much.Banks hire security experts. Governments hire the lowest bidder.Government officials hire their friends.One problem is that the government often goes with the lowest bidder- the company that claims to be able to do the job for the lowest price. Too often, these companies do a shoddy job. Plus, when these systems need to be fixed or upgraded, the government either gives that company another contract (which gives them no incentive to provide a good product in the first place) or they open it to another round of bidding. The new lowest bidder might not be the same company, so now you have one low bidder fixing the problems of another low bidder. It's not just the government, many (probably most) companies do this tooHigh quality software is undervalued across the board and enduring the costs of shoddy software (including the inevitable rewrite of the whole fucking thing) is *much* more expensive in the mid-to-long term than just writing it well in the first place.Shitty software is more expensive over time, but unless the person selecting the contractor knows the difference all they see is the price tag.Except they are not doing fine. Their supposedly offline computer containing the master keys has Pokerstars and bittorrent installed. Those in charge of the system might think it's a-ok, but the reality is, that shit is not to be trusted.Sounds like some people need to face obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence charges. This was my question exactly.  &gt; J.Tom Morgan, a former Georgia prosecutor, said destruction of the drive would not be a criminal act unless it was in violation of a protective court order (It appears no such order was requested). But it could seriously damage the defendants’ case, he said.I thought "discovery" was a thing after any suit was filed, and that messing with discovery was illegal?Constitutional amendment anyone?"Tampering with any electoral process in any way, shape or form shall be considered as the highest form of treason".Ho-lee shit. Welp pass the tin foil I guess. But seriously, this is the type of blatant cover-up shit that makes movies seem implausible and conspiracy theorists seem like nutjobs.it's easier just to assume the worst until proven wrong. that's what i do hahahaha...:(That way, if the worst happens, you're prepared and if something good happens, then you're in for a happy surprise!And you have a tin foil hat left over too! net gain for sure. Funny how this is part of the *one* conspiracy /r/conspiracy dismisses out of hand and receives 'unverified' flairs.Does anyone doubt that Reddit will be exposed as one of Russia's most successful active measures? Five years from now Reddit will be far, far more disdained than FB or Twitter. It's so damn obvious. social media was a mistakeIt requires you to expect people to be good. Russia's entire MO is to find spaces like that, and encourage people to be bad. You can use social media to stay in touch with your friends. *You can also use it to attack people.*The First Amendment is great because you can't be oppressed by the government for what you say. *You can also use it to promote fascism, racism, and fake news.*Democracy is awesome because it lets the people choose the best leader for them. *You can also use it to choose the worst leader.*Russia is jamming its thumb into every pie cooling on America's window sill. Sure, we should be able to leave pies unattended, but that's not the world we live in anymore. /r/conspiracy has an agenda. That place isnt just for conspiraciesWatch where people come down on this to see who's for fair and valid elections.Considering the defendant is a republican - and is currently running for governor... I'm guessing republicans will come to his defense.F that, as a Republican we should be just as pissed about this as we were about Hillary's server. Anyone trying to defend this is putting party over principle and honestly I'd rather those people just fk right off out of voting.Thank you. I swear at some point people started treating their political party like it was their favorite sports teamNot true, people criticize their favorite sports teams all the time!&gt; Anyone trying to defend this is putting party over principleWelcome to ~~2017~~ politics. Let's just see where elected officials come down on this.Just an FYI:  Putting party over principle is *not* a 2017 phenomenon. I lean Republican. Anyone involved can fuck right off to jail.That's not a red flag at all&gt; “People who have nothing to hide don’t behave this way.”This quote can be applied to almost every story surrounding the election. This really isn't surprising for a former Soviet nation.  Oh.  Shit.  This was Georgia, the state?  Which is part of a Future Soviet nation.If they did do a full and proper wipe, lets hope they used a non-standard wiping pattern.  Saw a case a while back of a guy accused of stealing company secrets before going to work for a competitor, his Flash Drive that had been used on a work computer had been formatted to spell out "FUCK YOU" all the way down the drive.  the unique wiping pattern ended up successfully being used to prove intent to destroy evidence. The real question is: why is a state university in charge of the elections server?This is the same state university where the governor installed his attorney general as the president when the old one retired. This was a HUGE deal b/c KSU has it in their charter that a search committee must be responsible for finding an appropriate president. Olens (the AG who has no education background) is currently caught in a political scandal with voters over cheerleaders kneeling during the anthem. It's a total mess by the GOP good ol' boy system in GA from all angles.Practically the entire state and local government is a good ol' boy system, you have scandal after scandal all the way through the system. As incompetent and downright malicious as the feds can be, Georgia state and local government is way worse. "States rights" my ass, a malicious state government is just as bad as a  malicious federal government but you won't see many people who continually bring up states rights talk about that. Live in a small town where the large businesses are literally in bed with the local county? Well get ready to have all kinds of shit fucking over the residents to get a better profit margin for fucking cleetus' construction contracting company.&gt;It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.*&gt;**The Kennesaw election center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican who is running for governor in 2018 and is the main defendant in the suit.** A spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office said Wednesday that "we did not have anything to do with this decision," adding that the office also had no advance warning of the move.**I'm no detective, but this really doesn't seem like too much of a mystery to me...And the new president of the university is a good friend of Kemp and former attorney general of the state. He got his job despite outrage and university pushback too.Wow, way to prove that the system is indeed flawed and needs to be retired.I am really hoping this act of panic, destroying evidence, helps to get rid of these flawed machines. Maybe the actions here will catch the public imagination. I hope soAnother classic case of: MOTIVES UNKNOWNRemember, folks, a complete hoax. All of this incriminating behavior you see his just coincidental, and *you're* the crazy one for being so hung up on it. /sWhat, like with a cloth?At this point what difference does it make. This is enraging, I just wish the average American was educated enough to understand this.* The server was wiped on July 7, why are we only hearing of it now, when the interest in Russian interference has waned?* How was the server AND two backup servers wiped?* Why is it reported that the data is unrecoverable? Making data unrecoverable is not easy, you have to really work at it. I've used forensic software designed to recover intentionally wiped data and you have to put a lot of work to hide data from that type of software. Even then, there would still be logs!* Why doesn't the FBI know whether or not they have the backup? Is the image of an election server just floating around? That's evidence of a fucking federal court!The people are being played hard and it's only a matter of time before we realize it.Yeah, no votes were tampered with, whatever.That story changes with every leak to whatever the least damaging thing is that they can credibly claim.The rest of the world is looking at America and wondering what the fuck is going on. This is 3rd world banana republic shit. America is looking at America and wondering what the fuck is going on.*Some of America is looking at America and wondering what the fuck is going on. Anybody else get thru a good part of this thinking it was Georgia the country? Literally thought this is terrible but good thing I don't live in eastern eu... fuckThe files are IN the computer Every person working on Georgia's elections should be fired, from the top to the janitor.  Zero tolerance for this travesty.I think we can probably give the janitor a break, man. Yeah, the janitor is busy wiping other things.There isn't much point in having elections if election officials are free to ignore a responsibly reported security flaw then wiping the election data and backups when they are being sued for their conduct. It's an insult to democracy that this outrageous conduct doesn't even warrant criminal charges with serious jail time.fired? more like jailedWhy would you jail the janitor?!He knows where all the dirt is.Who else would wipe the drives clean?Who do you think wiped the hard drive? Obviously the janitor, he's the only one with the cleaning supplies!Rich people wanted this, nobody will be punished.Correct. There is still too much support for the official state party. Corruption isn't tolerated, it's expected. Every Georgian who voted Republican would be happy to learn that their party cheated to win the special election. Integrity isn't top on their list of principles.The janitor only wiped the floors, not the servers! No, not fired. Indicted.  Compelled to testify. Barred from working in this area again.  Given a felony record and placed on a list to ensure that they don't get within 100 feet of a polling station.We might catch their admin asking Reddit for advice on wiping servers."Hey what is the safest method to clean data and then to be  unrestorable , I'm asking for a friend "VERY VIP friend.This brought back so many memoriesMueller just bought a ticket to GA.If all of the election records were completely destroyed and since the results can not be effectively examined and validated, the entire Georgia election should be declared null and void and a new special election managed under the the authority of the federal courts should be held ASAP.Why can't we vote on these devices then get a print out so we can at least look at how we voted? Then take said piece of paper and put it in a box which is then used as the recount. Also, we have to dip our finger in ink that won't wash off but fads away after a week or so. So, then we can point out everyone that didn't vote. There was also a documentary on HBO about a women from Washington state that went to Sarasota, Florida after the 2000 election and provide it was rigged. This is all known. The voting machines are crap and it has been proven over and over again. In the end money wins.   
It's a remarkable find, to be sure. But the headline implies all that weight is original to the speciment.&gt;As it lay there undisturbed, the armor and skin were replaced by minerals over the course of millions of years. This gave it the form that it is currently in, on exhibit.The outside layers were fossilized, so of course it's really heavy.It's still pretty friggin amazing though. You can see the shape of the actual body, beyond just skeleton. That's a god damned dragon or something. Imagine a primitive person seeing something even *like* that. They stumble on that fossil. Imagine the stories.Oh, yeah, absolutely amazing! It says there may even be some remnants of organs!Let's clone us some dinosaurs! I vaguely recall seeing something exactly like that before that leads me to believe that that wouldn't turn out very well.I loved that documentary! Bacteria and viruses have had so long to evolve, I doubt the cloned dinos would survive.A virus that has evolved specifically to attack mammals, for instance, won't have much luck with a dinosaur.one that affects a wide range of avian species might be able work with dino bio chemistryI mean, don't various religious texts mention dragons?It does look like a dragon. I was wondering if maybe others were found way back in history and led to legends of dragons. I can't stop looking at the photos. Poor thing looks like he's sleeping.As its a fossil... like coal... do dinosaurs burn well?The article itself is just as misleading, with even the researchers making media-friendly comments like it "might have been walking around a couple weeks ago!"Eh, I dunno. I used to be a reporter covering a research university. A lot of scientists talk like this. What can you say, they love their jobs and get excited. I would too, I reckon.Oh, no, didn't mean to imply that the researcher *deliberately* said that ([edit] to imply anything other than the reality).  But the reporter glomped on it like a pimply girl at an anime convention.&gt; Since it was unearthed it has kept its shape; its bones aren’t visible and even some of its innards are still intact. Researchers are amazed at the extent of the almost unparalleled degree of preservation.&gt; The dinosaur is so well preserved that it “might have been walking around a couple of weeks ago,” Jakob Vinther, a paleobiologist from the University of Bristol, said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”This is the only section of the article that discusses it. I think you're being a bit hyperbolic.Of course I'm being hyperbolic, but "innards are still intact", "preservation", "so well preserved", etc.  My point is that the reporter is painting a *very* specific picture that supports the notion that it's all flesh and blood.Ah, so that's why all fossil pokemon become rock type.Not just the outside layers. Bone usually becomes fossilized through a process called Permineralization where all the little holes and pits and microscopic nooks and crannies are filled in with minerals mixed in with the ground water. While the original bone material is mostly intact, it is so thoroughly embedded (down to a molecular level) with other minerals, it truly is more stone than bone. Alternatively, some organic material can be completely replaced (called Replacement) with minerals like sulfur, hematite and iron and thats how you get those fossils that look like gemstones. The original material is completely gone and in its place is a fossil shaped gemstone. Exciting shit. I got some really crazy fossilized wood opals. Like huge branches of rainbow. Check post history You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of Dino nougat.So, you're saying we can't eat it? &gt;The outside layers were fossilized, so of course it's really heavy.Bummer. I thought we had a good estimate for the weight of its soul.I mean, if you look at it, you can already tell that most *of it’s missing. They only have the fossil of the upper armor layer.The Royal Tyrrell is a pretty neat museum.  The landscape around it is pretty cool as well with the hoodoos.I remember sleeping under a trex on an overnight trip there which was pretty awesome.It's fun trying to convince people that Alberta has a desert with hoodoos and everything. Alberta has every fucking climate at once.My headaches agree with you."It's 35 degrees, there's a tornado, and it's snowing. What the fuck kind of vortex do I live in where the laws of physics don't apply?"And rattle snakes!hoodoos? hodors? hold the doors?&gt;I remember sleeping under a trex on an overnight trip there which was pretty awesome.That sounds magical.Did it come to life ala night at the museum?Its one of the coolest museums I've been to. I went once at 7ish and again at 22, it holds up.Did the same thing in grade seven. I was under a pterodactyl myself.https://www.ocado.com/productImages/437/43789011_0_640x640.jpg?identifier=85d66d3138c3d58eae64d0fd762272cbOk, that is just cool. Clicked expecting the usual no pictures of the amazing discovery, was pleasantly surprised. Clone it! Seriously though, MRI'S and CT scans? Let's see the inside without messing it up. This could mean that dinosaurs could be making a comeback. The mummy is sometimes a stage of hibernation.it goes to show how that even dinos had trouble losing weight but still perfect for Reddit: Dino caption: Here's me 500lbs later. Obviously he was on the keto dietPaleo is more likelyDumb question, I thought dinosaurs had feathers, or was that just raptors and T-rex? Is this from an era before they had feathers? The feather thing is a bit exaggerated. A lot of a specific type of dinosaur had feathers and from there we get birds. This kind didn't.Not all dinosaurs had feathers (Or proto-feathers) and feathers might not always fossilize as well as hard plate structures and bones under many conditions. [Most dinosaurs](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140724-feathered-siberia-dinosaur-scales-science/) had feathers- but not all of them. This is incredible to see!I have some naughty underside pics of it for r/DinosaursGoneWildInteresting side story. I've heard of European tourists driving for an hour or two on the prairie to get to this Museum and being overwhelmed by the vastness of it all. Overwhelmed is probably pushing it. You know there are, like, farms and shit in Europe. It’s not a foreign concept to have open space. I've driven for hours in some places without hardly seeing a car and it was unnerving as fuck. Especially when there's no cell coverage (outside Thunder Bay or Sault Ste Marie, Northern Alberta or Saskatchewan) and it starts snowing. Overwhelming? Hardly though. well, to be fair, if you drive an hour or two in europe, you'll end up in another country. probably france.Maybe if you were in Monaco. Europe isn't as small or easy to traverse as you've been told.If I drove 2 hours from my old house in Germany, I could be in France, Luxembourg, or Belgium. 10 more minutes would be just over the Netherlands boarder. That is one well preserved nodosaur!I thought this was just a sculpture, I can't believe that's realIt's not....they probably found 1 bone or look like a bone and just sculpted the rest as they've done with all dino bones.6 year old me is telling me it’s an ankylosaurus. Current me is frustrated that this one doesn’t have the hammer on the tail.Well, it's an [ankylosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosauria), but it's a [nodosaurid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodosauridae) ankylosaur, which means it doesn't have the tail mace.Thank you! I was completely oblivious to both the terms and the distinctions. I blame 6 year old me.Amazing. My wife put ON weight after ages.Holy shit that's amazing, looks like a 3D printIt's amazing that we've gone from no 3D printing at all, to saying that real fossils 'look' like a 3D printing is astounding!Hey in a million years, someone might excavate our 3D prints! It's amazing to think how long these species were on earth compared to man. It's amazing this survived for 100 million years in such pristine condition Wow, that is just beautiful. The eyes on this fossil are incredible.Weight loss journey's can take a while. This Dino has awesome patience.So maybe some animals and people really are big boned.Looking at the pic I'd assume it was a sculpture if I wasn't told it was a fossilA really beautiful curation, too.that's one of the things royal tyrrel is known for, really well done displays.Do not steal it's gold.How did the museum obtain the dinosaur after it was found?do dinosaurs found in Canada go up for auction or does the government instantly own it and give it the museum? I bet it would cost billions...The government owns the fossils.  It is actually illegal to remove fossils you may find from Alberta.They didn't call it Funkasaurus, after its discoverer, though.So no feathers?I haven't been to the Tyrell museum in a long time. Sounds like a good time to check it out again.At last! Proof the soul weighs 500lbs!yo mummy is so fat that after she lost 500 lbs, she still weighed 2500 lbs.can you make a real dinosaur with the mummy fojnd, i wonder :thinking:&gt;Over 100 million years ago, when this ancient prehistoric creature roamed the earth, it was a member of a newly discovered species and genus named the Nodosaur.Newly discovered 100 million years ago, hey? That’s a terrible sentence. Learn to read, sentence is fine.Nope. It’s a run-on sentence. Any journalist who went to school and wrote this should be ashamed of themselves. I would just like to mention this was found in the oil sands in Alberta. It would've never been found without the open pit mining.You know you're a parent when... I read Dinosaur mummy and thought it was going to be a mama and her baby dino... upon seeing the picture I was puzzled, how did they know she was a mom? Where are her babies or her eggies? Ohhhh... a MUMMY. So, if fossils are put on the earth to "test Christians' faiths"...Why is this here?You really trying to start a religion/science debate? What good do you think is gonna come from that?That's not trying to start a debate. It's a cheeky shitpost. No you are! Sorry for the sensitivity mate.Some people just want to watch the work burn.Checkmate, religion.
Good, if he isn't willing to do his job, that is what he should do.Or you know.. he could not do his job out of protest, break the law, get sued, and have the taxpayers pay all the legal fees! That's fun yea? [Kim Davis](https://www.courthousenews.com/kentucky-taxpayers-must-foot-bill-kim-davis-case/)Or he could refuse to do his job, get fired, get elected to the same position again, refuse to do his job again, get fired, and get elected to the Senate.Fuck Roy Moore with a rusty sideways pentagram.&gt; Fuck Roy Moore with a rusty sideways pentagram.Well, that's inventive.With how hard he fucks my home state on a daily basis, it's the least I can do for the geriatric klansman.Why do we never see Christians protesting the consumption of pork and shrimp? Both those things are also banned in the Bible.For the same reason they don't protest divorce, because its something they benefit from. We all know why. You can't say it tho. It's not right wing politically correct. What, that the beliefs of contemporary American Evangelical Christianity aren't really based on the Bible and nobody follows them anyway? It's the lie beneath all of American culture.Frist of all how dare you Fist dare all of your howFisting you how all of dareWell, that and Christians aren't actually Jews, and the New Testament explains several times that Christians aren't obligated to follow Jewish laws.In fact, this is the primary point of the book of Hebrews.Then how come they're all about divorce and remarriage?Jesus was very explicit about that and how it's adultery.What, don't you get your religion on the cafeteria plan, picking and choosing the bits you like?You're absolutely correct, and this is a very valid criticism. Many smaller evangelical groups still teach this doctrine, but most churches don't, simply because their members would be offended. My own grandfather used to preach that this was a sin, and recently he officiated my cousin's second or third wedding.&gt;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.I think it's important, however, when criticising hypocrites, to know what they claim to believe, so that you don't get sidetracked into minutiae. Attacking them for eating bacon is rather silly. Pointing out that Jesus said anyone who puts away their wife and marries another except for fornication (which is specifically *pre*marital, not *extra*marital, sex,) commits adultery, is right on point (when talking about a sect that has abandoned this doctrine Henry VIII-style, anyway.)Doesn't Jesus say something like "Yo, I'm not here to rewrite your old laws, and everything the prophets said before still counts and all them old rules still count too?"Atheist fella who hasn't read much of the Bible asking out of curiosity, as this particular part of Christianity (selectively choosing which parts of the Old Testament matter) fascinates me.u/sopissedrightnow84 is pretty accurate. I'd also like to point out that Paul instructs Jewish Christians that Gentile Christians aren't required to follow Jewish law, but that if they choose to do so in part, they're obligated to follow the whole thing.If you're interested, I'd recommend reading through the book of Hebrews. The writer (generally assumed to be Paul) is concerned with this very topic, explaining first that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, and that the old testament, or covenant, is fulfilled, and there's a new one now.I'd add to the earlier commenter's analogy my own: it's a contract. The old contract is in force until the parties concerned have fulfilled their obligations. The author of Hebrews argues that God fulfilled his contractual obligations to the Jews by sending Jesus, and that Christians are signatories to an entirely new contract.If that is the case, why do Christians often point to Old Testament scripture to justify positions? Are there parts that don't count as under the contract, and if so, how do you separate the contractual obligations from the rules still to be followed? EDIT: It's worth noting I'm curious, not aggressive or attacking you or your beliefs. &gt;Doesn't Jesus say something like "Yo, I'm not here to rewrite your old laws, and everything the prophets said before still counts and all them old rules still count too?"Not exactly. This is a commonly misrepresented passage where Christian and nonbelievers alike too often aren't familiar with the theology behind it. It's fairly complicated but I'll try to explain concisely. The entire religion of Christianity hinges on Christ as the fulfillment of the Law and what's called "the new covenant". Basically what this boils down to is that Christ didn't abolish the Law, he fulfilled it.He says that none of the Law will disappear until everything has been accomplished. He accomplished his purpose (the fulfillment) when he gave himself up to die as a willing and perfect sacrifice and was resurrected the third day. Think of it kinda like the laws of physics. They exist and we have always been bound by them. Humans cannot fly, we cannot go over certain speeds, and we cannot throw over a certain distance. But then someone comes along and because of those laws is able to invent a plane, a race car, a slingshot. The laws of physics are still there. They still apply. But thanks to the actions of an inventor we are able to do all these things we could never do alone. Their "grace" if you will extends to all willing to use what they have been given. The inventor accomplished his purpose within these laws and because of the laws, and because of him we are not so tightly bound by them any longer.It's a loose analogy, but hopefully it gets the pointb across. What part is Gandalf in?The Apocrypha. It's not canon, just fanfiction.Don't worry he reappears later on for an all-white cameo ;)&gt; Basically what this boils down to is that Christ didn't abolish the Law, he fulfilled it.&gt; He says that none of the Law will disappear until everything has been accomplished. He accomplished his purpose (the fulfillment) when he gave himself up to die as a willing and perfect sacrifice and was resurrected the third day.No offense, but this is simply horsepuckey. The full passage (Matthew 5:17-19) is as follows:&gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.Clearly him being resurrected did not make the "heaven and earth disappear". Nor did he say "until my purpose is accomplished", he said "until everything is accomplished". "Fulfill" means to fulfill the prophecies contained in the Law, not to get rid of it. The meaning of this passage is quite simply clear as day. He says largely the same thing in Luke. At no point in any Gospel does Jesus ever even imply that the Law is not fully binding. It is not until the later books that we suddenly find that God has made everything clean.It's unfortunate that some people have decided they would rather make up their own readings than simply take their religious books at face value. I think it says a lot about a certain lack of faith in what you believe.&gt;No offense, but this is simply horsepuckey. You'll have to take that up with the theologians. I'm curious, what is your theological background? &gt; "Fulfill" means to fulfill the prophecies contained in the Law, not to get rid of it.Which is basically what I said. Maybe I wasn't clear or maybe you don't understand what fulfillment means in this context. &gt;The meaning of this passage is quite simply clear as day. Obviously not since it's a common point of discussion. &gt;At no point in any Gospel does Jesus ever even imply that the Law is not fully binding. Oh, I guess we're ignoring all the examples of Christ and his disciples not adhering to the Law? When he refused to stone the adultress? When they picked grain and healed on the Sabbath? When he went among the unclean? When they didn't wash their hands properly? When he dismissed 'eye for an eye' and divorce laws? That's convenient.&gt;It is not until the later books that we suddenly find that God has made everything clean.You do understand that Christian theology is largely based on these "later books", yes? &gt;It's unfortunate that some people have decided they would rather make up their own readings than simply take their religious books at face value. What exactly do you consider "face value"? And where exactly do you think these readings you refer to come from? &gt;I think it says a lot about a certain lack of faith in what you believe.That's interesting since I don't recall ever stating my personal beliefs. All I've done here is pass on some basic theology. The majority of priests, pastors and preachers will explain fulfillment and new covenant when asked about this passage. You should be careful about assumptions. They don't always pay off. &gt;Which is basically what I said.It's very telling that you literally do not spend one sentence in any way attempting to defend your reading, except to say "Well that's what other people told me!" Let's make this simple. You claim that Jesus's "until everything is accomplished" actually referred to him accomplishing his purpose by being resurrected. Explain how that fits with "until heaven and earth pass away" in the same passage. &gt;That's interesting since I don't recall ever stating my personal beliefs. ... You should be careful about assumptions. They don't always pay off.I didn't say anything about you, I said "some people" - "you" refers to those people, not necessarily to you. I'm perfectly well aware you didn't come up with this on your own.Probably because religions and societies change over time, and adapt to the problems they face at a certain time.What happened to those societies?They're all over the world right now. Some have gone and some have thrived. Some are very orthodox in their beliefs and others change with society.&gt; Both those things are also banned in the Bible.Because Christianity and Judaism are different religions and scripture directly addresses the food restrictions in the NT. Peter's vision is the most common teaching on this issue. Most of these "gotcha" passages have long been addressed in theology. I think you forgot what bacon is made out of.^ ^Liberal atheists on reddit talking about the bible, omg so cute.Look how cute they are guysTo be fair, the elected state government granted her the sole authority to issue the licenses on behalf of the state, then refused to impeach her when she illegally misused her state authorized power.It stinks for the taxpayers who didn't vote for this, but clearly the state government holds responsibility, and the average taxpayer voted for that government.Man, Kim Davis really makes me despise the wealthy christians that make morons like Kim Davis behave the way they do.Then gets invited to Romania as some sort of crusading warrior. ~~Three~~ Four eyed cousin fornicator. &gt;Good, if he isn't willing to do his job, that is what he should do.There is nothing wrong with a judge recusing himself if he knows that he cannot be impartial. The judicial system cannot work if we issue blanket recusals in this manner.  There are only so many judges and you can easily get to a point where no local judge is willing to hear a case.  This man didn't have a conflict of interest he just simply doesn't like homosexuals and refused to act impartially.If he was a bigot and had a previous altercation with a homosexual then decided to recuse himself from a court hearing with that same person there wouldn't be any issue.  But you cannot just make a blanket statement that you won't rule impartially on any case involving a homosexual.  I don't think he was recusing himself from every case involving a homosexual, just homosexual adoption cases.  I don't think there's anything really extraneous about that, and I'm not sure what the alternative would be.  Banning people with certain cultural or religious beliefs from becoming judges?  That sounds like a far, far worse road to go down than a judge, correctly, recusing himself from homosexual parent adoption cases.You can believe in your religion all you want, but if you let it interfere with your job, it is a problem, not because of your belief, but because you refuse to have any semblance of empathy or impartiality. You have to execute the laws whether you like it, believe in it, or not. The job of a judge is not simply to "execute the law", it's often a very subjective decision making process. Every single person is biased about lots of things, many having nothing to do with religion.  Realistically, any judge will have certain types of cases that they *should* recuse themselves from.  Some do so, some, unfortunately, do not.  It's absurd and regressive to use a judge's decision to recuse themselves on religious grounds as evidence that they are unfit.  That is the same as saying religious people should not be judges, as any beliefs as personal and strong as religious ones will result in cases where recusal is the right course of action.A judge, realizing his personal views preclude giving a fair hearing to people recuses himself so those folk can get a fair hearing, and you think it's a *good* thing?Edit: you think it's good he resigned?Yes, he's a better person than those who give biased verdicts but refuse to admit their biasHe resigned because the process to remove him from the bench was well underway.  He's still an asshole though. Disagreeing with someone or something does not make you an asshole. Treating gay people as second class citizens does in fact make you an asshole. Recusing yourself from a trial because you don’t want your personal feelings/beliefs interfering isn’t treating gay people like second class citizens. It’s actually the not asshole thing to do. He made sure this gay couple got a fair, unbiased hearing. His belief that gay people shouldn't adopt kids means he should treating gay as second class citizens. And you're defending him. Shame on you.Yeah, because people have the freedom to believe however they want. Luckily, this guy didn’t let his beliefs affect the adoption process for this couple. He did exactly what he was supposed to do. And if you say no, that he should instead just change how he feels/believes, you’re no better. Acceptance is a two way street. People getting a fair hearing? Yes, I think that is a good thing.yeah it's good, because what other backwards medieval beliefs does he hold that he isn't ashamed of?I was going to say, this is actually quite honorable.Not really... He could just grow up,  stop being a bigot, and do the job his country asks of him..Or.. you know admit he can't do his public position and step down. Sure he didn't gain tolerance, admits fault, and walks away from it and if that's the best this man can do, he's no longer taking others down with him.Everyone is entitled to their opinion. He shouldn't have to agree gay or lesbian couples should be able to adopt. The fact that he realized he couldn't remain impartial and removed himself from the position is very admirable and self aware on his part. Thinking everyone should think like you is no less close minded.Bullshit.  He didn't step down because he "realized he couldn't remain impartial" he stepped down because:&gt; The Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, which is the disciplinary arm of the judicial branch, formally charged Nance in September with several counts of judicial "misconduct,” for, among other violations, prejudice and not following the law.He never would have resigned if he hadn't been charged. &gt;saying they would need to request a special judge if they had an adoption case involving gay people.Sounds to me like he recognized his bias and tried to avoid hearing the cases as opposed to just ruling against gay couples like a lot of judges do. Sounds to me like someone with an old fashioned way of thinking who tried to avoiding putting himself in the position to rule on it, but unfortunately he just isn't allowed to do that. Well, his approach is certainly more honorable than hearing the cases and ruling against the adoption, I suppose.  Even more honorable would have been to never have run to be a judge in the first place, knowing that your personal beliefs would interfere with your ability to properly do the job.If honor was his concern, he would challenge his own own beliefs, weigh his own bias, and give children a loving home and a better life.He resigned because he was under scrutiny. Nothing honorable about that.Name one person who doesn't have personal beliefs. Where did I suggest he shouldn't have personal beliefs?  I am saying that a judge is not supposed to let his personal beliefs interfere with his ability to properly adjudicate legal matters.You effectively started that anyone whose belief system doesn't conform to your ideals shouldn't be in a position of influence. Thinking 2 people shouldn't be able to adopt a child who needs a stable home just because they are Gay is the definition of being close minded..Right, but part of being open minded is realizing not everyone has to share your views. Thinking he's wrong for feeling a certain way is just as close minded.Is he being close minded? Sure. Do I think he's wrong for it and need to change? Absolutely not. His views arent harming anyone else so he's free to think what he wants.I think everyone with bigoted views should challenge themselves to be more accepting. They *do* need to change their views because they oppress people and make the world a worse place..Not all opinions can be considered equally.. Some opinions are just clearly morally superior..I do not think that being intolerant of bigoted people is equal to being intolerant of Gays or any other minority. These people need to change for society to progress. Otherwise we might as well just become like Saudi Arabia...By your logic, your intolerance and hate of others values and lifestyle should not be tolerated.I completely disagree. You can not agree with gay or lesbian people and not be oppressing them at all, that doesn't even make sense. I don't agree with a lot of the "-isms" that people throw around today, but that doesn't mean I'm oppressing anybody. Not everyone has to agree with you and your "safe space".No one said anything about a "safe space". You do not understand what you are talking about.Thinking that Gay people shouldn't be able to adopt is wrong. There is no acceptable reason to believe that.. If you do then you are just 100% a bigot. You would be just as bad as someone who "Hates Blacks" just because they have a different skin color.Just because everyone is entitled to an opinion does not mean that every opinion should be considered equal.. Some people's opinions are just idiocy and bigotry with no substance behind it..Everyone is entitled to an opinion, you just said it yourself. Whether or not you think its wrong id irrelevant. No pleasing libs. It's not enough to tolerate their degeneracy, you have to participate and smile.Are you saying that being gay is "degeneracy".. ? Or am I interpreting your reply incorrectly?I mean, most muslims feel that way towards gays so why are you so surprised to hear that No, indulging in homosexuality is degenerate. Sounds like you can't even.I can even. Your hunting for downvotes, I get it bro..*You'reYou say that like saying it makes it instantly true and irrefutable. Try harder.That’s just like your opinion man. A pretty piss poor one too. Do some reading, think about the big picture, get healthy then rejoin society when you’re ready.The big picture is that the promiscuity of gays makes them a great breeding ground and reservoir for STD's like HIV. There's a reason they used to call it GRID. Never mind the social consequences of rampant and public homosexuality.  I am well engaged with society, I am a healthcare professional and have to deal with the consequences of degeneracy in our society every day. I will say that is some mighty fine newspeak, where one is "unhealthy" if they don't subscribe to liberal propaganda.&gt; I am a healthcare professionalLearn from this judge and resign.Nah it's a good living and I like the job. Plus I have no issue taking care of the degenerate. I am a Christian, I will help all who come to me in need.No it isn't.  He only resigned because he was being charged with judicial misconduct which would have ended with him being removed.  He is simply saving face and money he would have spent fighting the case.if it were an unethical part of his job, he would have a point. But he doesn't, he's a shit.seriously, he should lock those pedos up.    I can't believe the audacity of a couple of degenerates trying to procure their victims via a court. Meanwhile cities across the United States refuse to cooperate with the Feds around immigration enforcement.Issuing marriage licenses is a job specifically delegated to the states.Immigration is a federal issue, the states/cities are under no obligation to help the federal government.Well that would be like if someone came to the Judge and asked him to start processing evidence for the police.Thats not the judges job. Its not the polices job to enforce immigration. That's a federal task. Local law enforcement has zero legal obligation to enforce immigration nor is it their job.Meanwhile cities across the United States still won't give me ten bucks. See how silly it sounds? What you're describing *ISN'T THEIR JOB, THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT DOING IT.* I'd really like those ten bucks, I'd go out and get some beers. maybe the feds should enforce their own damn laws and stop expecting states to do their work for them?This. Especially when their laws are bigoted.Immigration enforcement is a federal role, it isn't the job of cities around the United States.Maybe the feds should drop a few billion on each of those cities to pay for enforcement expenses.Interestingly, the judge appears to have been trying to do sort of the right thing by recusing himself, at least according to the statement from his lawyer. He apparently recognized a personal bias and attempted to issue a blanket recusal rather than take on cases where he knew he had a personal bias. At least, that’s how it’s being portrayed. The issue in this particular case, according to the article, is that blanket recusals are not allowed. They should be done on a case-by-case basis. Also, he apparently instructed lawyers that they would need to seek a “special judge” to have their gay clients’ cases heard - also not allowed. So, in a sense, he seems to have thought he was doing the right thing to ensure those families got a fair trial in front of an unbiased judge. In a way, it’s too bad more judges don’t do that. However, if all judges were to start recusing themselves due to personal bias, it would create utter chaos in the justice system.  Likely many cases would go unheard due to inability to secure a willing judge. But this is why we have so many finely detailed laws and courtroom procedures: to ensure that checks and balances are in place and recourse is available to overcome instances of personal bias among judges.  Also, there is a principle here. Any given person should be able to go to court and feel assured of a fair hearing no matter what personal bias a judge may have. A judge should be good enough to be cognizant of his or her biases and keep them in check. No one should ever have to suffer the humiliation of being told they have to wait for a special judge to take their case because the regular judge has a bias against their race, gender, sexual orientation, etc., and no one should ever have their hearing delayed for these same reasons. I work in mental health, a far less rarefied and prestigious position than a judge, and my code of ethics requires me to leave my personal biases at the door.  If I can do it, so can they.&gt; Interestingly, the judge appears to have been trying to do sort of the right thing by recusing himself, at least according to the statement from his lawyer....&gt; The issue in this particular case, according to the article, is that blanket recusals are not allowed. They should be done on a case-by-case basis. Also, he apparently instructed lawyers that they would need to seek a “special judge” to have their gay clients’ cases heard - also not allowed.I was going to ask whether recusing himself from these cases was actually the ethical thing to do. Thanks for explaining the issue.Recusing for this kind of thing is lazy.  It's not allowed in my profession because of the potential harm to a client that can happen if a professional refuses to have them as a client for a reason that the client is likely sensitive about.  We're talking just hurt feelings.  How much more damage does it do to a person to have a judge refuse to process their legal proceedings?  Come on.  It's really not hard to do.  It's unpleasant to do, but that's the job.I live in his jurisdiction. He retired in an attempt to avoid a lawsuit by the couple he had denied an adoption to. Also his “principals” ALWAYS meant he sided with the woman in the family court cases he heard. I know this because my ex, as well as many other fathers who have had the misfortune of having him preside over their cases, decided that she wasn’t receiving enough monetary support from me after I was remarried and took me back for “ all I can get” as she put it on a document she provided me demanding more money from me while giving me less time with my children. She had been remarried for nearly 4 years by this time and is living large in her 5 bedroom home with indoor in ground pool, brand new vehicles, house boat, and so on while I can barely afford a two bedroom apartment due to the nearly $500 a month he ordered me to pay, even though she makes and brings home more than I do. He even had the nerve to tell me the undocumented, unordered money that I had been paying to help with extracurricular activities was “a gift” that I had decided to give to her, even though I had the text messages saved and presented proving that she was threatening to withhold my scheduled visitation if I didn’t pay her more. I have no criminal record. Not even a speeding ticket and he decided that all I was worth was 8 days a month with my two boys and upping my support obligation to nearly $500 a month.  His “principles” can go screw themselves. Good riddance. Maybe now good fathers might stand a chance in Barren/Metcalf counties. Being from Kentucky, I'm surprised he wasn't promoted. It seems like Kentucky is going through some weird political identity crisis politics wise. Is this accurate?Kentucky is a sea of red with some large blue cities. There are also 'democrats' in the central part of the state that don't actually have anything to do with the national democratic platform, such as Kim Davis. &gt;Kentucky is a sea of red with some large blue cities.Isn't that, like, almost every state?Yes, although I think that KY is a bit extreme. Blue states have blue cities that shade to purple in the suburbs, red states have red rural areas and purple cities, but KY seems to have very blue cities in Louisville and Lexington, with VERY red suburbs and rural areas.Just an offhand observation though, no actual data. I live in Lexington but having moved here from a much more liberal area, I'm so baffled when people call it "very blue." There's so much red everywhere. I guess it's blue by Kentucky standards, but it's the most unpleasant place I've ever lived because it's still so comparatively conservative. Jefferson and Fayette would be the blue counties that come to mind if we're just talking extremes, though, you're right there. If I have to live in this state, I'd rather live in Lexington than most other places. I live in Nky so I'm more 'greater cinci area' but visit lexington/louisville areas often. It does seem to be a huge clash with very little mix.I'd say what you are seeing is this oddly placed clash where you may find some very liberal people, shops, and stores but i'll be damned if you don't find some super conservative people, especially in our public offices.Rural Ky and almost immediately outside of the larger cities is very conservative.Hey, I live in that area, too! You're pretty spot on. Louisville and Lexington seem so out of place once you drive out.I'm about an hour and a half south of Lex on 75 and while my generation tends to be pretty liberal, the "ruling", for lack of a better word, generation is still very staunchly red.Not really. There are many Democrats throughout the state that hold progressive views, and while not all Kentucky Democrats are really progressive, Democrats hold large majorities in counties that are not at all urban, and in some of those counties, the party leadership at least is decidedly progressive. Well, I know one, for sure. Presumably we're not unique.&gt;Just an offhand observation though, no actual data.You'll need to overlay [this](http://kycir.org/2016/11/07/red-or-blue-your-countys-political-leanings-and-more/) with an actual map."Yes, although I think that KY is a bit extreme."(not to be confused with the Kentucky Xtreme or K-Y Extreme, unless, you know, you do)"That Kentucky Jelly doesn't taste very good on a sandwich..."Lol I hate to say it, but Louisville and Lexington aren't that blue. They vote blue overall but there are a *lot* of people that are just as red as the rural areas. Louisville, for instance, is easily one of the top ten most segregated cities in the country&gt; There are also 'democrats' in the central part of the state that don't actually have anything to do with the national democratic platform, such as Kim Davis.Because she thinks it's still the '50s.Her hair says 1850sPeople who hold those values are called "Dixiecrats", and there is an entire segment of US history revolving around the reasons why they exist and persist.Right, didn't want to go into it in that much detail for a simple reply. But there are generations of families who vote D locally, just because they always have, but vote R nationally. Kentucky definitely has its share of Dixiecrats, which always amused me considering we're not part of the South. Kentucky's described as the only state to join the Confederacy after the Civil War ended.West Virginia was formed specifically to be Northern but they would have you believe otherwise. I am from Maryland and they called me a yankee.It is. I live here. I don't think I've ever seen this state turn away from red in any fashion aside from Louisville and Lexington. [deleted]Kentucky is almost always red for potus actually. &gt;A Kentucky family court judge who refused to hear adoption cases involving gay people has resigned instead of possibly being removed from the bench for misconduct.More like forced out, which is as it should be.It's common knowledge how fucked up the foster care system in our country is. I'd rather a child get adopted by a homosexual couple who will raise them right than get sent to some sickos who will abuse them.[removed][removed]&gt; Actually, gay people have higher rates of mental illness and domestic violence than straight people.You completely pulled that nonsense out of your ass. Downvote for your lying. Here, why don't you take a look at the "ass" I pulled that out of. Would you like to apologize, or would you prefer to double down on being an asshole?https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/LGBTQhttp://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/lgbt-mental-healthhttps://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-and-Sexual-Abuse-among-LGBT-People.pdfhttps://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-assault-and-the-lgbt-communityThe more important question is: is being gay the cause of mental issues or is the discrimination towards gays (exampled by this judge) the cause of mental issues? Holding socio-economic factors constant, is the isolated factor of homosexuality causally related to mental illness? The articles you listed say that the cause of mental issue can be traced to the discrimination in the public sphere and job market as well as in the society.Being married to a shrink, and having had this convo before, I think the consensus among mental health professionals is that it's both. Here's a little bit of a curveball- you may not know this, but homosexuality was actually itself considered to be a mental illness until a few decades ago. While that might seem rooted in hate, it's actually not. It was more along the line of thinking that homosexuality is counterproductive to one of the most important aspects of our species' survival. In other words, if everyone refused to eat (anorexia), the species does not survive. If everyone is suicidal (laundry list of disorders), the species does not survive. If everyone is homosexual.....so it's kind of a tricky situation for mental health researchers to address because in today's social climate they risk being labeled bigots or hate filled. Interesting stuff for sure. Similar issues arise with transgender. That is interesting but also very weird... by that logic, are celibate clergymen and women mentally ill too? How about people who just decide not to have kids? Both are counterproductive to the growth in our species’ population. Im not going to say it is counterproductive to the survival of the species. Because breeding like rabbits can also be counterproductive to the survival of the species. Homosexual animals exist, and in some species, they help take care of a herd's young to give them better chances of survival while not reproducing themselves and potentially adding to an overpopulation.  Same reason elderly people exist beyond the point of being able to reproduce anymore.  Having more adults around to help with the kids is better for survival of the species.  Life isn't all about "fuck, fuck, fuck and make babies, make as many as you can.".  That's only one tactic among many to guarantee survival, mostly limited to lower order lifeforms like insects and fish, that just pump out as many eggs as they can in the hopes a few of them will make it.  Animals such as mammals and birds display very complex and intricate sexual behavior.  Even so, animals as lowly as worms have shown homo- and bisexual behaviors.Edit: we don't listen to those dinguses from the 1950's for the same reason bloodletting isn't considered a valid medical treatment anymore.  We know now that homosexuality is a very common and maybe even important phenomena in nature.  Welcome to 2017.Interesting stuff, but I don't think it's ever been proven that there are any animals that are truly homosexual, rather that some partake in homosexual behavior. I guess that can be debated, but with an admittedly quick search of that topic it looks like scientists, as well as myself, feel that homosexuality is a trait, not a behavior. In other words, a lion eating a salad doesn't make it an herbivore. I remember seeing a BBC special about dolphins and they talked about how they actually had more male-male sex than straight sex, and they couldn't really figure out why, but they suspected it had to have some sort of evolutionary advantageous reasoning. I've seen where geese or something will often times have groups of girls that raise chicks together, but they're not having sex with each other, rather other males and then leaving them to raise their young. Is that homosexual? I don't really know. I guess it's pretty hard to say when looking at other animals. Hell, it's hard to say sometimes with humans. As for the other point, our life expectancy has skyrocketed in recent years for obvious reasons, and our bodies have not caught up. Chimpanzees, our closest relatives, average about 45 years in the wild, and stay fertile their entire life if conditions allow. The average age of menopause is 51. Coincidence? Maybe. But it would seem logical that our female bodies evolved to live to around 45, then suddenly modern medicine and fertilizer and steel and on and on came along and boosted our lifetimes well beyond the norm in a matter of centuries. Evolution can't play catch up at that pace. I'm sort of thinking out loud here - I'd love to hear an expert's take. Unrelated to the topic, but kudos to you for actually conversing like an adult. I think you might be the only person who responded to me that didn't include accusations of bigotry or the like along with their retort. Thanks for that. I'm confused about the tendency not to label animals as actually being homosexual and just displaying "behaviors".  If a male giraffe tries to breed and bond with other male giraffes exclusively, and is driven by the same lust and desires all of us mammals have to do so, would that not make that giraffe homosexual?&gt;Here's a little bit of a curveball- you may not know this, but homosexuality was actually itself considered to be a mental illness until a few decades ago. While that might seem rooted in hate, it's actually not. It was more along the line of thinking that homosexuality is counterproductive to one of the most important aspects of our species' survival.Honestly how do you not realize you are full of it? Apparently you are using bad logic and picking fights with more people than just me. One would think someone married to a psychologist with a family member actively questioning their sexuality would have a better understanding of how hate translates into bigotry.Here you are making the argument medical professionals cared so much about gay people they diagnosed them as mentally ill because the primary function of intercourse is procreation making "treatment" justifiable. You're going to have to cite one hell of a reliable source for the claim that the medical industry knew homosexuality was harmless and normal but classifying it as a mental illness was only intended to help fix a non existent problem.There is no hate here, that's you projecting. And I have picked a fight with nobody, perhaps you are blind to all the insults I have taken here for stating a couple factoids? What you, and others here, are doing is akin to calling me racist for pointing out that black people are more vulnerable to sickle cell anemia. I *thought* gay people wanted equality, as in to be treated like everyone else, but what I'm learning here today is that it's simply taboo to speak about them at all unless the discussion is purely positive, regardless of its relevance or factual nature. Actually, that's probably not fair for me to say as I suspect most getting upset with me aren't actually gay themselves, rather people afraid of being labeled homophobic and overcompensating. I also suspect I'm pretty much the only one here who's actually learning and researching this as I write these comments as opposed to simply calling the other names. Here's to hoping you shift more to the side of reason as opposed to doubling down on calling me a bigot, closet homosexual, dumbass, etc. To address your comment, my source is the aforementioned wife, though I assure you that you can find an endless supply of opinions if you care to look. Psychology is not like mathematics or anatomy - its very essence is that of opinion. One thing I did find is that nobody worth their salt has ever consistently and successfully used conversion therapy to "cure" homosexuality. However, it's documented that suppression therapy has seen some level of success. Surprisingly, the APA's official stance even today is that homosexual suppression therapy has no harmful effects on patients, though many seem to think it's merely shifting them into sexual aversion disorder (along with depression, etc) which borders on malpractice.As for the history of homosexuality and its association with mental illness, I'm having a tough time finding a hard timeline. Seems that the foundation of mental illnesses are the church's view of what was or wasn't sin around year 1200, and people have been either confirming or poking holes in that ever since. Pretty funny to think about an adulterer being thought of as having a mental disorder as opposed to just being an asshole. Looks like Freud and some of the other "fathers" of psychology found homosexuality to be harmless in nature, and useless to attempt treating, but found a parallel with gay subjects and other mental disorders involving narcissistic traits. Another associated trait is Oedipus complex, who Freud believed began at age 3-5, long before a gay person would start feeling societal pressures on their sexuality. Also they found the obvious, that external expectations cause stresses that trigger mental illnesses. So per Freud and his colleagues, it looks like there's a little bit of both inherent mental illness and external causing to be had among gay people. That's pretty consistent with what I've heard in discussions with my wife. And before you get bent out of shape with Freud for being a "bigot" or whatever endearing terms you like to throw around, know that he actually encouraged his patients to give in to their sexual desires regardless of where that took them, finding nothing wrong with bisexuality and homosexuality. A man that could recognize high rates of mental illnesses in gay people without actually hating them. Imagine that!Now, if you want to actually have a discussion with me, I forgive you for treating me like dirt. I'll chalk it up to you misreading my intentions or just allowing yourself to get caught up in hive mind or whatever. If you can find some stuff that adds a little more clarity, I'm all for it. Like I said, I've found it tough to find any real hard and fast timeline on this. Seems that for every opinion there's an opposite, and there's information overload. But if all you want to do is throw around insults, please go find someone else to bother. My patience with that is wearing thin.Your wife, and you give way too much credit to the medical industry in its intentions and accuracies when it comes to issues like this.Frankly, I think you are trying to have an open mind about your daughter, the LGBT community, and the concept of gender(hopefully), but if all your opinions are in common with your wife, those opinions are skewed by what the professionals in the industry have created, promoted, and subsequently rejected. Freud is even proven wrong about plenty of his theories. His work was important in many aspects but he did tons of damage as well and you shouldn't toss his name around like he is an infallible representative of forward thinking in his time. History recognizes him as a pioneer and rightly so, but fails to recognize his failures.Should your daughter eventually recognize she isn't heterosexual, you will have a personal stake in your opinions that may have a more equal counterweight to your professional opinions of the industry as a whole, and those opinions will change.One only has to to look at the horrors of mental institutions over the last 200 years to recognize medicine was used as the justification for removing the undesirables from the population and then saying it is in society's best interest. Why do you think all that occurred? How do still not understand calling LGBT people mentally ill without acknowledging the actual reasons actually fuels bigotry. It's why people who know this never fail to discuss it in proper context.That is what I got on you about and I think others as well. You are still evolving on these and other realizations. Maybe you won't be forced to actually confront any of this and can go on about your merry way too.GL with your daughter. Never forget she needs your support first and foremost.Ask your ‘shrink’ wife what actual psychology holds true for idiots who do vehemently oppose the gay community.I’ll give you a hint, there are a wide number of studies that show idiots like you are suppressing you own gay feelings and turning that hate outwards in an attempt to show others how not gay you are I don't even need to read your sources to know that the entire LGBT community has higher rates of mental illness because 9f how society treats then, not because they are LGBT.Stop pretending people like yourself aren't part of the issue misrepresenting facts. Bigots are the perpetuating source of societal trauma.And their higher rates of sexual assault and domestic violence are because.....?LGBT folks most definitely suffer from higher mental illness rates in part due to societal stigmas, but to pretend that somehow erases facts is ridiculous. Why on earth would you chastise someone for presenting factual information? Looks like you're getting overly defensive or going out of your way to be offended. Ironic how you'll accuse bigotry of causing harm while insulting someone for presenting facts. Not liking the truth doesn't change it. Check yourself. Tell me what fact I'm dismissing.Apparently reading comprehension isn't your forte. &gt;but to pretend that somehow erases facts is ridiculous.I'll ask you again. Tell me exactly what facts.What a retard. You don’t even grasp the simple concepts you are talking about. The higher rates are due to people sexually assuming the LGBT community at a higher rate, and same for domestic violence Oh look, someone throwing around insults rather than conversing like an adult. These studies are largely survey based, so if LGBT rates are off it's because people lied about their sexuality.[removed]He also probably ignored the research that says kids raised by gay dads don’t turn out any worse than normal, and (of average) kids raised by lesbian moms turn out better than average...especially cosnsidering how many of those kids have been through neglect, trauma, etc...I say this as a gay guy who intends to make up the slack :) It's amazing that you can just quit and face no repercussions for completely refusing to do your job for years.So just to be clear, you're for forcing people to do a job - regardless of whether they think it's right or wrong - and punishing them even if they just want to quit because they think it's wrong?That's completely missing the point. You're imagining a situation like a secretary being forced to retile the roof, which they would be right to refuse. But this situation is more like a secretary being forced to answer phonecalls, them refusing, and them being fired for refusing to do a job they had agreed to do when they were hired.And the repercussions would be......getting fired! If they quit then there's nothing else to do. Not sure what else you want. This isn't Soviet Russia, you can't jail people just because. The judge is guilty of wrongthink. Off with his head!No but deportation along with all the cheeto fans sounds good. So...Russia maybe? 😊When you're a government employee, you shouldn't reaaaally be able to pick and choose what parts of the job you want to do. It's the same thing that got Kim Davis in trouble and is now costing the government of Kentucky money in lawsuit settlements.Not like we we are known for properly handling money here, like say give special breaks to a giant non floating boat. Edit: Lmao I agree with the above post which gets upvoted and I get downvoted. Reddit is forever a mystery.&gt;So just to be clear, you're for forcing people to do a job - regardless of whether they think it's right or wrong Absolutely. If you sign up for a job, you should be forced to do said job or quit. Don't sign up for a job that makes you do something you think is wrong.&gt;and punishing them even if they just want to quit because they think it's wrong?Nope, I completely disagree with him on that. He resigned because he was likely going to be fired anyway. That's his punishment already. No need for further punishment unless he broke some laws that require further punishment.I disagree.  Sanctions or disbarment would be reasonable given his actions, IMO.Actually, yeah, disbarment would be fair too.He ran for the position knowing full well what it entailed. He can’t then complain about being forced to actually fulfill the duties he voluntarily agreed to perform by running for the office. If he the refuses to fulfill those duties, it is not unreasonable for him to face consequences. If he felt he would be compelled to fulfill duties against his beliefs or that he could not perform in good conscience, then he should not run. Seems pretty simple. The job of a judge is to adjudicate hearings based on the law, not based on personal beliefs that run counter to the law.  So, yes, you should be forced to do your job.  The punishment proposed was for all of the past violations of job duties, not strictly for quitting.  If the judge had quit the first moment he was asked to hear an adoption proceeding of a homosexual couple, that would be somewhat reasonable.  Somewhat.Nice work confirming stereotypes there Kentucky.Well, they make Bourbon. Doesn't come close to making it a place Id step foot in but I'm glad the Bourbon exists...

"The National Archives needs the official approval of President Donald Trump to begin releasing the 35,000 documents online ....as of Thursday afternoon, the memo specifying which material the CIA, State Department and other agencies still want to keep under wraps had not made it to Trump’s desk"I guess 25 years wasn't enough to figure it out."The CIA is asking only for some redactions, not for all the documents to be held, the official said. But the other agencies involved in the process have not yet finished their submissions."Uh hu. Nothing suspicious at all."Some" out of 5 million documents could be a hell of a lot of redactions.Donald J. Trump killed JFK. I don't mean he hired the hit, no, I mean he literally pulled the trigger and murdered the 35th President of the United States. Back then (and today to an extent) Trump was member of the KGB. He worked with his comrades as well as Cuban nationals to plot the murder and make sure some low level player took the downfall. Trump releasing the JFK docs is a response to internal deep state pressure to expose himself. Trump expects the parts naming him will be redacted, but they won't be. CIA will make sure of it (THANK YOU CIA). Trump will then resign in utter disgrace and Pence will take over. That is until Paul Ryan produces incontrivertible evidence DJT colluded with Russia, at which Pence will resign and Ryan takes over. (Ryan hasn't been able to produce evidence yet because DJT has him on vid giving McConnel a handjob[it's fake video don't worry]). Once Ryan gets in office he will then prove Hillary was cheated out of the office, and declare her the rightful president, and on November 8th, one year to the day Hillary was a victim of election fraud, she will take the office and right this country's true path to the stars.To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎The "personnel" at the end is by far my favorite part of this copypasta.It really is the cherry on the proverbial ice cream sundae It's from a Sonic the hedgehog related meme, if you weren't aware.

It's a fun show that may attract some high IQ fans, but c'mon...it's not high humor.To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand copypasta.Clearly they do not have a solid grasp of theoretical physics Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!May not be high humor for you but I’m always high when I watch it. Thank you for that laugh Thank you for laughing!You took the baitIs this your first day on the internet?I'll have you know I have been a certified internetter for 17 days and countingPure goldSound like something you would find on r/politics.Out of 35000Well consider there might be names and locations of shit that they want out?  Like, "We were considering launching Nuke #1161 from the underground bunker in Minnesota disguised as a Burger King, but it seemed like a risky move."Could be that stuff.I was thinking something similar. People, places, or programs mentioned in the documents might still be active or could give away current information. Alternatively, it could all be a conspiracy to protect the lizard people. 50/50 either way.25 years? Shit happened in 1963. It’s been 25 years since these files were ordered to be released. Not since the assassination.It's not 1988?[deleted]25 years after 1963...just the fact alone that our own government is redacting facts from a presidential assassination tells you that this was either 1. An inside job, or 2. An inside job.  What harm could it do if this was just some crazy guy acting alone and finally after 25 years letting Americans know what happened? Well There was talk about the Time Oswald was in Mexico city the month before the event and the CIA had all this intel about it, but maybe they want to withhold some of the important information about that so they don't publish which spies they had in Mexico.But hey, that's a pretty nifty cover story for the delay and the redactions.Yet the US government just released its version of what happened in indonesia and our then government were exposed as complete assholes. So why does it seem to matter so much for this incident?  Because it was a President?  In my opinion the people of our country have been told for the past 50 years that "our country is the greatest" yet examples like this, Iran, South/Central America and multiple other endeavors seem to suggest we do what our Politicians want and they completely ignore the electorate.   This isn't the bill of sales I was sold, so when are things going to get better?&gt; our then government were exposed as complete assholescould be that they always wait like this because the documents expose people who were in power as incompetent, and they couldn't get things moving until nowmaybe not just in this case, but in a lot of others as well. it doesn't have to be a unified conspiracy to keep us in the dark, just a few nobodies on the sidelines holding things up because they're afraid of being outed as complete assholesUnless they are still using some of those techniques or those spies are still active (doubtful) I can't see why those things would matter.Actually, such editing is usually to conceal intel sources.  For instance, people who were active spies back in 1962 might still be subject to retaliation against themselves or their families. If, for instance, they mention a 'Juan Perez' was the local source for information about inquiries into links to Cuba, because they might need to contact him again, that needs to be cut out of the document.Though for fuck's sake, they knew they were releasing this shit since long ago.  There's no excuse to wait until the last minute to do things.  At least a year ago, they should have started reviewing.Why would they waste money doing something that they haven't been ordered to do? From a department budget standpoint, it makes sense.Pretty terrible leap in logic.[removed]Lmao calm down broI called this. Trump was and is trying to take credit for them being released at all, and I knew he'd hold things up.&gt;The White House said later that the remaining records would be released "on a rolling basis in the coming weeks."Why? *More distractions.* He thinks whenever something harmful to him is in the news, he can just drop a batch more of documents to change the conversation. I don't think that will work more than once, though. Regular people don't personally sift through those things. How many people interested in Sandy Hook acutually looked at all the thosusand and a half pages dumped a few days ago? *I'm interested* and even I just leafed page by page through 3/4 of it, pausing to read when some non garbage came up. There was a lot of duplicates and duplicate forms (interview or grand jury subpoena), for example.Most Americans will just read what's been released by way of their favorite news organization, who'll have a team of people summarizing for us and they'll all report about exactly the same thing. I doubt there's any bombshells to be revealed. Some people will be distracted but I think "boy who cried wolf" will come into action. They'll soon grow bored when they realize nothing exciting is coming out and they aren't going to take the time to look at the documents themselves.Edit: another couple of thoughts:If these had been released 20 years ago they'd be a much bigger deal. Most of the people who are old enough to rmember and emotionally connect to JFK's death are dead. To many today, it's more of a curiosity. Trump was 17 years old when it happened and he might think it's as interesting to young people today as it is to his generation.And why were the Sandy Hook papers unceremoniously and unexpectedly dumped earlier this week? Another distraction?  I'm pretty sure they just weren't prepared for the President to actually have them released. He is truly an outsider.Every single negative thing we've seen in the news about Trump has been disproven or falsified, and he is continuously right about things. Oh, if only Hillary had won! Nothing of this would be happening, the files still gathering dust on the shelves of the archive, all secure and secret.Especially funny cause Trump already made a big deal taking credit for releasing these. Delayed?? 25 years wasn't enough time??I'm imagining some poor middle-aged dude sitting in an office surrounded by files, coming to the same job every day for a quarter of a century and banging his head against the wall as he writes "redacted" for the 1,000,000th time. Goddamnit, *'take the summer internship at the National Archives'*, they said, *'what can it hurt?'*, they said... That dude has the cushiest Job in Washington, until now.  Every day he comes in to work, builds a new file box fort out of the evidence boxes.  He sits inside Fort Kickass 2017 with his phone and peruses /r/conspiracy and floats half a dozen new thories before lunch, they're all bullshit but it helps him pass the time.  Then after a healthy two hour lunch and another 45 minute shit.  He knocks off early and goes home.  Once every decade or so he has to redact something with a magic marker but for the most part his life is good. If you think the guy with access to classified data also has a personal cell phone within two miles of him your are mistaken.Hey, they got caught by surprise - they were completely sure the president would keep them sealed by executive order, under the excuse of national security threat. Then that nutjob Trump happened and took them completely by surprise...Decades to prepare for this and they're still not ready. Our finely tuned government machine at work folks. They ran out of black highlighters.Government machine 🅱rokeThey use yellow ones then scan them. They come out black."steve what the fuck? why did we release it with all the shady dealings highlighted in yellow?""oh shit I think I scanned it in full color""goddamnit steve this is all your fault"Look, you know how it is. The deadline starts out a decade away so nobody works on it and then suddenly you have to go through a bazillion pages of crap by next week.Sounds like me, and every paper I had to do in college."Due in two weeks? That's months from now!"FInE tUnEd MACHiNeDecades to fake the files and they're still not ready. RidiculousDidn't you ever wait till the night before to do your homework?Yeah, but I didn't have 25 years to work on it, and I'm not the government.To be fair, the government is supposed to be slow at everythingYet we're supposed to trust them with our healthcare.Public healthcare is the usual system in most developed countries, it's cheaper, and no country's voters have ever wanted it to be repealed. So yes, it's a good idea. The US government is so grossly incompetent it'd be foolish to put them in charge of healthcare.The US government already does great healthcare. Senators and the military enjoy it every day. Plus great air traffic control, fire departments, running the internet, checking food safety, running NASA, etc. If every other developed country can do it, you can. And there's no reason you can't have a parallel private system that has to compete with "free".Its genius really. Get elected using corp.$...then do nothing productive. Then say: big gubbmint is not the answer/the best gov. is that which governs least...and proceed to privatize everything under the sun for your corporate sponsors (aka: your real constituants)It's literally being delayed by Trump and his staff.So don't bag on the entirety of the government because it's being run by incompetents.No it isn't. The article literally states that various government agencies haven't submitted the appropriate documents as to what info needs redaction. Only the president is authorized to delay it after today's date. Moot point now isn't it? I got a CNN notification about an hour ago that they were released by The National Archives. Dude, come onr/conspiracy on suicide watch.I love to look at what they're saying. Literally everything is a conspiracy haha. Are they really expecting to get any information we didn't already know about?Probably not now.Well there are 32,200 documents that were supposed to be released but were held back because there might have been something in them that people didn't know about so yea, I guess they were. You go to r/conspiracy and thinks its funny they talk about conspiracies...No, I think it's funny that literally everything is made into a conspiracy. What could possibly be a threat to national security after 50 years? Apparently, they have to protect their confidential sources and informants... in 2017 when they're either dead or have one foot in the grave.Of course, they couldn't just black their names out or anything. They still have family. It probably also names the location of safehouses in other countries, could mention the location of nuclear weapons if they ever looked into counterfeiting at Russia or Cuba or wherever if it was their fault. Stuff like that. Im all for a good conspiracy but there are plenty of valid reasons for them to still need to keep some info under the table.What isnt acceptable is having 25 years to prepare and then not doing it until the deadline. I would expect better from community college students, never mind one of the most powerful government bodies in human history.&gt; Im all for a good conspiracy but there are plenty of valid reasons for them to still need to keep some info under the table.Bullshit.  They are just covering their own reputations.Take a guess.Government : It was just a lone nut case closed nothing to see here. Ok release the files then. Government : Um we can't it's a huge national security concernLOLThat's not what happened You know, I wasn't a big believer in conspiracy theories, until I hear the CIA is worried that the release of information concerning events of over 50 years ago is a National Security concern.  Maybe the CIA did kill Kennedy.A conspiracy doesn't explicitly mean fake. It's just a wild theory that may or may not be true. Obviously a conspiracy. Lee Harvey Oswald trying to pull strings even from the grave. Like he had anything to do with the assassinationI know, right. Obviously it was fidel castro and his russian buddies who kidnapped an american soldier and programmed a series of numbers into his head, with the hope that he'd kill president JFK; only to have their efforts thwarted when Alex Mason - I mean that nameless soldier - becomes aware of the plot to exploit him, and so dives into the ocean and disables a command center which was about to release the NOVA gas onto the world. At least, that's what I was taught in my history class. you're mileage may varyI see they've gotten to you too. The Rand Corporation, in conjunction with the saucer people, under the supervision of reverse vampires, assassinated JFK in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of dinner!Where was Donald Trump on November 22, 1963?His dad’s balls.17 years old and still in dad's sack, that would be miserable for both parties.Nah, Ted Cruz is just delaying things till his dad can flee back to Canada.We don't want him or his dad back thanks.No you got it all wrong, it's the grassy knoll that's behind the curtain here.It was the Mafia. Kennedy was breaking the cardinal rule of the family. DO NOT FUCK WITH A MADE MANS WIFE!     Especially the head of a fucking family.      Kennedy was porking a Don's wife.   No, we had a problem... and uh, we tried to do everything we could.   He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it.   That's it.   He's gone. Uh, he's gone.  And that's it.    It was **[Redacted]** in the **[Redacted]** with the **[Redacted]**!Colonel Mustard in the Library with the Candle StickRed dot appears on your chest. I was never good at risk. 😦This is a big joke.  Why even play around with it if you're not going to be 100% transparent?Have you ever been to a DMV? What did you expect??They're out:https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/2017-releaseGonna need a good handwriting expert... lolYeah, I'm just gonna wait till tomorrow when somebody transcribes and breaks it down to the important stuff. Im way too lazy to start lookong through myself hahaAnd based on what I've seen so far, redacted to fuck.Whatever happened to the GAO?  There needs to be audits.  I'm seeing some really mundane stuff in the unredacted releases that had no reason to be secret all this time.What are documents from 1975 doing in there that have nothing to do with JFK?  The 1975 documents aren't even anything substantial, just some comments about how Ford and Kissinger are going to do a speech.https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32105718.pdfThis one I guess because they mention the USSR and assassinations? They also mention sending nuclear weapons to Israel, I guess that's why it wasn't released before.The CIA is still trying to maintain the cover up of its complicity in the coup.Because when our government says they will release records in 25 years they mean that they will release records in 25 years. unless of course they decide not to. &gt;But as of Thursday afternoon, the memo specifying which material the CIA, State Department and other agencies still want to keep under wraps had not made it to Trump’s desk, **U.S. intelligence officials** told NBC News.So ~~their~~ *they're* dragging ass? It sounds like they are dragging ass. Also didn't Pres. Trump say basically everything is to be released? So doesn't that mean everything? Large scale Bureaucracy at work!Trump just announced he will follow their guidelines and not release everything. lol.He said that he is giving them time to demonstrate the need for the redactionsPer the law any agency involved has the ability to request documents be blocked.  This in turn starts a review process of those specific items that the agencies want blocked. &gt;Per the law any agency involved has the ability to request documents be blockedRight but if the pres who has the ultimate authority on declassification says otherwise, that is the end. It's like the child saying they don't want broccoli to their mom. Might work before mom handed them dinner but too late, decision has been made. Unless of course he hasn't signed anything on their release which sounds like government level retardation. &gt;These will be released unless you block them! Or unless we don't give you the paperwork to sign to release them when they are slated to be released. Now that I think about it, this sounds like the most probable. saying a thing doesn't matter, he needs to do the thing.Well, he doesn't becasue apparently his follower will say he did whatever he says he did regardless of the mountain of evidence they are presented with.You're surprised he lied?He didn't lie, buddy. Both the FBI and CIA "suggested" that they need more time to redact and burn documents, which meant that a mandatory review has to be conducted, delaying the documents anyway. Not everything is a plot by the president.And who did they suggest that too?Read my comment. He has no choice but to wait for the mandatory review. Look it up for yourself if you're too thick to understand.He also said everything will be released. He didn't say somethings. Everything. Again, can you read? It's not up to him anymore. He's not a dictator, he can't just release thousands of classified files without a confirmation from both intelligence agencies unless he wants a lengthy judicial battle and/or a hostile future relationship with said agencies. Think before you say idiotic garbage.Trump said that releasing them unredacted could cause "potentially irreversible harm to our nation's security"So the Saudi's did it.He lied. Shocking I knowI don't like this. This is the time the president should call out the  three-letters. It is inexcusable the memo is not on the president's desk. What the fuck are they hiding? I'm not a conapiracy theorist, but this is most definitely fishy to say the least. Probably the government digging into foreign information to see if there was some kind of outside influence.Are they trying to make it look like they have something to hide? Or just not aware of how their actions are perceived? (OR they do have something to hide and couldn't do it in 25 years?)“I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted. At the same time, executive departments and agencies have proposed to me that certain information should continue to be redacted because of national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns. I have no choice — today — but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation’s security. ”Wow, those are some pretty serious concerns.. what the hell are we being kept in the dark about that people's reactions would be *that* bad?All this, just to protect Ted Cruz's father. Sad. ^^/sI wish I was surprised...Why doea any of it need to be secret at all? This has to mean there is something to hide right? Otherwise whats the point?Jesus Christ. Apparently the files released to day will be redacted. CIA is hiding somethingI’m sure there are 1000’s of redacted versions.  So it takes time to find the MOST redacted version to release.   All nouns and verbs are vital to national security!Watch for an "event" in the next 24 hours. Calling it now. What do you mean? Ted Cruz can't let his father's name be ruined.Waiting until he can release it while also quietly announcing something he would rather not talk about.Gotta delete the juicy stuff first..Anyone surprised?We need *just a few more days*... it’s almost complete! Yes, the guy was probably most likely assassinated because he called for an end to "Pax Americana".Though he did plenty of damage in his own liberal anti-communist Crusade, including the Bay of Pigs / Operation Mongoose, failure to pass real Civil Rights legislation, failure to pass real comprehensive pay equality for women, reducing the top tax rate on the wealthiest class of Americans from 90% to 70%, trying to pass legislation to make it illegal to speak bad about America overseas, initiating "on the ground" hostilities in Vietnam, and a few more doozies....He did talk about toning down the Cold War, passing some financial reform, pulling back the FBI and CIA, making government overall more accountable to the people.That's probably why he was killed, however, we will never have any concrete proof and no real evidence will ever be released.That said, I'm sick and fucking tired of hearing the eleventy billion different dumbass conspiracy theories surrounding his death.[deleted]Literally has nothing to do with Trump, but keep on circlejerking..[deleted]I just want to know it there's time travelthis is gaslighter in chief stirring up some drama and deflection... cause you know, he's got troubles... God damn duckin Donald[deleted]You're reaching past levels that many deemed impossible.Eh, this one isn’t really on him. Various govt agencies are holding this up as they review everything. Is there anything this administration can't fuck up via incompetence?Yes, because it's **Trump's** fault that the three-letter agencies which largely hate him aren't ready after *25 years*.Another Trump lie?&gt; In that memo, Donald Trump **blocked the release of an unknown number of files**, saying he had “no choice” but to accept the concerns of agencies such as the FBI and CIA. For days, he had hyped the release of the documents as a victory for the public that would be “so interesting!”There won't be anything interesting to see, anyway.
This is the higest level arrest I've ever seen in the pharma industry. The charges including racketeering, conspiracy and fraud...Let's hope it turns into the highest level conviction in pharma. People need to start being held accountable.If it is a federal case then it most likely will result in a conviction.  The federal government is not known to take a gamble on a high level cases.  They only press charges when they are sure they will get a convictions. Except for the Malheur occupiers, they pretty well screwed that up.I'll take anything that helps defrauds these assholes and promotes the legalization of other things..I know a lot about drug abuse, I abuse drugs in the county that has the highest % of overdoses in the country. Even more so than the county in the netflix documentry Heroin(e). This is nonsense, noone that abuses drugs is doing it with nasal spray. This wouldn't even be a drop in the bucket to combat the current drug epidemic. I'm not sure outlawing all opioids would do too much. You would make a bunch of heroin dealers happy and a bunch of poor people a lot poorer. You would likely end up doing something you really don't want to do, like producing a marked increase in violent crime.  Robbery, murder, ect ect. If the past what 70 years of prohibition on things hasn't tipped you off I really don't know what will. I think a few prosecutions like this after the financial crisis would've done wall street a ton of good.  Now they're lobbying to pare back many of the Dodd-Frank reforms, as weak as those were.Yes...hopefully this is a sign of things to come. That 60 minutes whistleblower documentary really got the ball rolling. Props to the DEA agent for being so brave to come out against them.It has to be pretty scary speaking out against people who are that rich, man. Super rich people will completely destroy your life and the lives of the people you love if you speak against them.When you play the game of thrones you either win or dieyeah one of the few true heroes in politics.Seriously. They can pay people without scruples to follow you around, crazy shit like walk up next to you at Starbuck's and mention the school your child attends, illegally eavesdrop and try to hack you, all kinds of mustache petting evil shit. Even worse is a lot of these people are ex LEO, so they're plugged into the system. They can also hire firms to sue the shit out of you, completely overrunning your ability to fight back resource wise. It shouldn't be scary. Rich people don't care what you think, so us common people just need to be smart - or united. The glorified future most people wish to happen will start with a generation that just decides to get shit done for themselves and causes equalization by actually DOING things. That's a nice sentiment.which documentary?I'm going to assume this one: (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-dea-agent-opioid-crisis-fueled-by-drug-industry-and-congress/)probably just the tip of the icebergWhat about the six executives arrested in December? This guy is a billionaire. None of those six were even close probably.This is nothing more than a dog and pony show. He will go to trial and there will be a shadow of a doubt that will exonerate him. /r/conspiracy has a lot more on this and other such thingsLet's hope the shady downstream business of patient recruiting resultant of shady billionaire also gets toppled.(This reminds me of the Y2K bug but with drugs and deaths)I guess enough people have finally died that action is being taken Not even. This is because of the 60 minutes episode. Trump declared it a "state of emergency" today too.He declared it a public health emergency. Theres a difference.Thanks for the correction. But regardless I am pretty sure his statement is because of the 60 minutes documentary. Marino also is no longer being considered for Drug Czar.He's been preparing todays statement for months, and even campaigned on it, so not reallyMaybe. I personally don't think Trump plans anything in preparation for months.The fact that the DOJ went RICO on this guy is pretty huge. I don't care if you have $100B in personal wealth, if the DOJ hits you with RICO charges, your ass is going to a Federal "pound me in the ass" prison.Usually when it comes to RICO, they've already got everything they need on you.u fuktThis will do nothing to combat the problem. The article say this guy produces a fentanyl nasal spray, which is what about 0.0001% of addicts I know use, or have ever used at all. So congratz, they've done exactly nothing. It's like they looked at the problem, found the person least culpable, and charged him.  The fentanyl in the spray is refined and put into fake pills to be sold as normal OCs on the Silk Road, that eventually make their way into the hands of people on the street, killing many.&gt; Trump declared it a "state of emergency" today too.Didn't that happen like 3 months ago originally? Not saying you're wrong I'm just having some major deja vu if he didn't. I thought that was what got the big public perception and response balls rolling.Second emergency he's declared about this.  Let's see there's actually action this time.When was the firstLike two months ago?Two months ago was when he said he was planning on declaring this to be an emergency. Today was that declaration.It won't matter at all. So that 60 Minutes episode resulted in outage, and rightfully so, due to 200,000+ deaths in the past ~20 years from opioid abuse in large part due to the actions (and inactions) of pharmaceutical companies and elected representatives.Meanwhile ~450,000+ Americans die from smoking-related illnesses. Every year.Let's not forget that the FDA protected Marlboro in 2009. Where's the outrage?The difference is there is a massive social stigma against cigarettes and the negative consequences. People know what they are getting into. Doctors aren't prescribing people cigarettes to get them addicted and shit. We should not forget to look at the politicians that took bribes to rewrite the law to hinder the DEA. Also, fuck the DEA.  The war on drugs has been a disaster and they are trying to keep it going.Its been a wild success for generating profit and consolidating power though.I will paraphrase the late, but always very great, Milton Friedman:"What government agency in the country will propose that they have accomplished their mission, fulfilled their objective, and then ask that they be disbanded? None. They will always exclaim that they need more money; they always need expanded scope."Again, that is not a direct quote, it is paraphrasing. You can expand this to any federal agency (including both the Department of Energy, created in 1977, and the Department of Education, created in 1979.) Except the whistleblower that went on 60 minutes and exposed their bullshitYes. Let us not forget that the DEA is the same agency that less than a year ago toyed with the idea of scheduling Kratom - a substance known in large part for its ability to get *and* keep people off opioids.Yes, kratom is not a permanent solution, but christ man, it's helping people. And they wanted to criminalize it.In regards to politicians and Big Pharma, people should also look into [Billy Tauzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Tauzin#Career_as_a_lobbyist) who *allegedly* helped Big Pharma write the favorable Medicare Part D legislation that prohibits the federal government from negotiating lower drug pricesI agree. Unfortunately its nigh impossible to prove bribery with our current lobbying laws. I wish there was a way to catch these crooks though.The French had a pretty good method about 215 years or so ago.The Reign of terror was one of the darkest and worst chapters of mankind lol and is seen as barbaric in nature.That being said, some of these people do need to be guillotined haha.The Reign of Terror happened for a reason and I am in the camp that believes the biggest cause was huge inequality coupled with callous elite (1%er's). Tell me how we are not headed down that road?Oh yeah, mass surveillance and unarming citizens and a powerful police state. "For OUR security"&gt; The Reign of Terror happened for a reason and I am in the camp that believes the biggest cause was huge inequality coupled with callous elite (1%er's).True, doesn't mean that the Reign of Terror wasn't barbaric in nature and is now seen as a black stain. &gt; Tell me how we are not headed down that road?Wealth inequality is getting worse, but isn't even close to approaching the wealth gap in 1700's France.A lot of angry people who were angry enough to vote for TRUMP would disagree. Americans are pissed about the direction our country is going. Don't for a second think that the recent elections have not shaken a lot of the establishment to the core. Before I get downvoted to hell I was not showing support FOR Trump lol. I know there are a lot of angry people, but as I said it doesn't even approach the levels of anger during the French Revolution. You obviously don't roll around the areas I do. You obviously lack a grasp of how pissed off people were in 1700s France and how unequal it was compared to today.People were literally starving in the streets in droves before France rose up in arms.Revolutions don't start happening until people cannot make enough money to afford food. &gt; True, doesn't mean that the Reign of Terror wasn't barbaric in nature and is now seen as a black stain.oh wow guess we shouldn't do anything then! pussy ass shit&gt; Oh yeah, mass surveillance and unarming citizens and a powerful police state. "For OUR security"Correct. American law enforcement is being militarized because rich people want aggressive wealth protection forces.Regardless if that is the goal or not it will be the outcome. If an uprising/revolution ever happens in the US, it will either be shut down almost immediately, or utterly destroy North America.Like all revolts, it depends on who the Army sides with and if the armed forces split on the issue. They should side with the constitution, as they pledge allegiance to that document before the commander in chief. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces_oath_of_enlistment “I, __________, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.”Yes when faced with going into American neighborhoods to kill Americans they won't feel any guilt because of some paper that none of them have memorized. You know just every single civil war in the history of mankind has had the military split and fight against each other or completely abandon the state. But for some unknown reason America would be the only exception in history. You've obviously not taken the oath nor lived the life. Most folks i know that have taken the oath, take it to the grave. That'd probably be the biggest roadblock to a change in the system; America has a military that would shut anything down.  You'd have to convince the entire nation that the military isn't worth going into or that it causes severe lifelong ailments (which it does due to the heavy levels of PTSD, which goes untreated).I wouldn't bet on it. Most members of the Military hate politicians and the 1% and are populated from the more rural or inner city areas in which the grassroots revolt would be the strongest. While your point about military personnel disliking politicians is true, can you really see soldiers or police officers siding with people that would be seen as traitors to the government?  I can't see it happening right now.  The military and police would have to be defunded and then forced to work even harder for that to happen.The Active-Duty military can't get involved without some serious law changes, and the Guard is limited to their individual states. That said, if Hurricane Katrina is anything to go by, they have zero problems saying no to the Feds asking them to violate the constitution. "Happened for a reason" and "good method" have nothing to do with one another.That includes obama who signed the legislation allowing this.He is a politician right? I didn't single out right or left.Someone is having sacrificial lamb today. More meat left yet in that flock.Accountability. If we can start enforcing that, what a beautiful country we could be.Isn't this the pharmaceutical company that paid 500k to an anti marijuana legalization campaign? Sceptical this isn't just for show but very hopeful someone pays the crime for many lives ruined.great now go after the rest of the pharma companies responsible for pushing opioids for chronic painSome people do need opioids for chronic pain...&gt; opioids for chronic pain...Opiods are good for short term acute pain, not long term treatment of chronic pain. Chronic pain should be handled differently. people dealing with cancer or end of life issues. this was the medical consensus until perdue decided they should be given to people who simply have pain - a lifetime of opioid addiction is not a good solution for back pain.&gt; perduePurdue Pharms makes drugs. Perdue farms sells chicken. Carry on. Who makes the chickens that Perdue sells?There is a small population of patients with chronic pain that is nonterminal, noncancer pain who should be on opiates. Patients who fail all other treatment modalities, have significant improvement in functionality and quality of life, and are closely monitored can be good candidates for therapy.That number is vastly smaller than the current population (back pain is the classic overprescribed condition) but there are chronic pain patients who absolutely should not be stripped of their meds. I deal with both ends every day. Opiates are overprescribed (sometimes even postop - 180 oxycodone 15 mg dosed q4h in an opiate naive patient is not reasonable but I've seen it) but there are also legitimate noncancer patients who benefit substantially and aren't abusing their meds. If someone has legitimately exhausted all other avenues of treatment but benefits from opioids, I don't believe you should leave them to suffer. OTOH, too many docs reach for them as 1st or 2nd line, and that shouldn't be the case. But saying "no opiates except for surgery or cancer" goes too far.Fuck you and everyone who thinks that those of us with severe chronic pain don't deserve any quality of life.  No, far more people than that.  Have you ever heard of something called "surgery" for instance?  You know, where they cut you open like a piece of meat and then you're in agony for a long time?The opium poppy has been the saving grace of pain relief for the human species for over 10,000 years.Suddenly deciding it's "evil" and humanity will crumble if exposed to it now is patently absurd.The drug war prohibitionists on their "crusade" against the opiates are going to fail just like every other prohibitionist before them.There will be just as many addicts as ever before, and all you'll accomplish is making innocent people suffer pain they needn't suffer while they're told it's "for their own good."God forbid anyone should make that choice for themselves.  Not with paternalistic, holier-than-thou, papa-knows-best prohibitionists on the case though.   I have to suffer and hurt because some junkie is getting high under a bridge, I have to suffer for his sins.  If I experience enough mind-wrenching pain, he'll clean up his act, right?&gt; "surgery"Acute pain, not chronic. According to the CDC, chronic pain is defined as lasting more than 3 months. A vast majority of surgical recovery resolves by 3 months.and opiates are often prescribed for the pain after surgery. Fuck them, tylenol and aspirin for you.Again, the discussion is about chronic pain, not acute. Surgical recovery is medically considered acute pain, where opiates are indicated.The discussion may be about opiate addiction and the connection to either the medical system or the black market. You can limit it to chronic pain, but usually takes the discussion away from the all the problems. Nobody disagrees with opiates for end stage cancer, and most other terminating diseases. Huge issues with identifying drug seeking behaviour amongst the non-terminally ill. Actual chronic pain is a problem for opiates, and drug seeking individuals are a huge problem. There are no "easy" answers, but there are some simple ones which may make things better. They also may not, they would need to be tried in place to find out.Um. Europe has had countries highly successful with being more stringent about prescribing opiates. Obviously if you have mind wrenching pain your still going to get your opiates. Yes, people with chronic pain related to cancer and for palliative care, not because of slipped disks or scoliosis.Up until the mid-to-late 90s and early 2000s, opiates were rarely, if ever, prescribed for chronic pain not related to end-of-life care. A massive and coordinated campaign by nefarious actors in the pharmaceutical industry lobbied heavily and put out junk science stating that managing pain with "non-addictive" opiates should be a primary concern of healthcare. So much so that most hospitals are now federally rated based primarily on patient surveys which rate "pain" as a primary category of emphasis. In so doing, hospitals err on the side of vast over-prescription than under-prescription. In just a few years, "pain clinics" were popping up in strip malls and highway exit ramps. And they're still there.and the doctors who wrongly prescribe themStart with legislation to make doctors run PDMP before dispensing. Force them to check who else is prescribing what to their patients. Takes 5 minutes and makes them accountable. There's legislation that would require this of docs in my state. The doctor lobbies are trying to shut it down as being "too onerous" and taking too much time when it would take less than 5 minutes to check.Also, criminal prosecution and license stripping for pill mill docs. None of this "$2500 fine and a reprimand" BS. They're getting better, but historically the state medical board has been very hesitant to suspend or terminate licenses.Patience. This is step one.hundreds of thousands have died - don't have any patience on this subject. the way companies like perdue ruined lives all over this country for a buck is unconscionable EDIT - curious that my other posts in this thread were upvoted but this was downvoted...do people not believe the number? 115,000 in just 2015 and 16 https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/02/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.htmlhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-painI get it. But again: This *is* an important step. Saying "not good enough" over and over is not going to achieve a thing.Nothing anyone says here will achieve a thing.That's just defeatist.Are you trying to accomplish something with reddit posts?Spreading good ideas and encouragement isn't accomplishing anything? Not that I can tell.  The community here certainly isn't getting more positive.This is a place for entertainment and nothing else.Certainly I can't do it all by myself, but if you think it's bad now, imagine if *everyone* were as pessimistic and defeatist.Be the change you want to see. We can all change the world in small ways, we just have to actually put in the individual effort.im not fighting this step - just looking past this to the next oneLet me ask this, where are the videos of his property being seized? John Doe drives down Cherry Lane with $2000 dollars on him and the cops simply say they think it is from bad faith and take it. But this guy is charged out right and nothing.Hopefully the police force goes through some much needed reforms too.Arrested, yes.  Sentenced?  I remain doubtful.They hit him with RICO charges...he's completely fucked. I'm sure that as we speak, his bank accounts have all been seized. He better hope he has a $100M retainer with a $2000 an hour law firm already paid (or money hidden offshore).The cracks in the dam are starting to leak.Death. The penalty here should be death because of the hundreds and hundreds of deaths this schmuck caused. I just recently got back in touch with my good friend who kinda dropped of the grid for two years.  Turns out her dr had gotten her addicted to fentanyl and it took her two years to get sober.   Fuck these doctors ruining lives and taking my friends away from me.  Fuckin despicable.   This is why I have a hard time trusting Drs.  There are good ones but so many bad ones and how can you really know  It's a consensus that the war on drugs is a total failure, but now people are in love with the idea of waging war on drug companies. It's the same thing. You cannon solve a drug problem with muscle and regulations. It's just doesn't work. You can put all the people in jail and make as many things illegal as you want, it's not going to stop people from getting addicted to drugs. Until we start treating addiction as the social problem that it is and treating the causes and mental and sociological reasons that lead to addiction rather than pointing fingers and casting blame, nothing is going to change.  Are these people scumbags? Of course. But insanity is doing to same thing over and over and expecting different results and that's exactly what we're doing and what we've been doing since the 70's. I mean in a lot of cases they are takin normal sober people and turning them into addicts.   A lot of these people would probably never touch drugs if they had not been prescribed to them by their dr What you're describing is a drug dealer. It's no different. A lot of people would never touch anything more than weed if they didn't go to their dealer and have them offer something else. I don't disagree with you, but they are identical to drug dealers in every way except they wear suits and their pushers are doctors. And now we're treating them exactly how we've been treating drug dealers for 40 years which hasn't worked. So why would this be any different? Honestly I'd try to talk to you about this more in depth like it's really interesting to me but I just smoked a bowl and took my anxiety meds so I'm just not able to at the moment.   I suppose I agree with what you're saying tho I'm not sure what the answer is. All I know is doing what we've been doing for 40 years has gotten us nowhere, so I don't know why that's what we're resorting back to. Since this is a whole new era of drug problems, we have an opportunity to try a whole new approach because we're starting from scratch. I would like to see the first step not be casting blame and putting people in jail. I hope the lobbyist and coves teams get in trouble too. Like the Nazi, everyone involved is guilty.Ah a token for the masses! Bread and circuses is all you need!!! Meanwhile the true crooks, the politicians are still sitting fat in elected positions collecting bribe money from every other pharma CEO that isn't indicted.I'll admit that I know very little about pharma and opiod prescription. This is a very bizarre scenario as I previously had a bunch of stock in insys but I purchased them hoping to turn a tidy profit with their mmj program. Weird to hear that a company which is close to releasing a marijuana product is also a scumbag opiod pusher. I’m just curious if anyone knows what agency (or agencies) made the arrest. DEA has regulation over this but so does FDA and I wasn’t sure since they mentioned marketing (an FDA issue). Or was it fraud  under the FBI?WSJ headline for this article (probably): "Anti-business prosecutors go after innocent Pharma executive"The comments: "Disgusting how poorly our producers are treated in this communist country!  How come nobody from government ever gets indicted???"Looks like somebodies campaign donation check bounced.Can we get the doctors who accepted the bribes?I never buy in to all the white privilege stuff we see lately but I find it a bit odd that all the sudden we are arresting criminal CEOs. We typically let them get away with Barely a fine and a public finger wagging. They all should go to jail for racketeering. When sales of opioids started to blow past the forecast market size, what did they think was going on? Imagine you are about to introduce the your company's opioid drug and you know that the market for your drug is to conquer  the (made up) $5 billion market size pain killer of a certain type. A couple of years later you and your competitors are selling $10 billion in product into a market that was only $5 billion in size. Yet you are working to keep sales growing.It has to cross your mind that something doesn't compute. The market is only $5 billion and you and your competitors are selling way more than that. Plus you have room to grow sales. Wouldn't you want to understand what had happened to the market? Who was buying your product, and why you didn't see them as part of the market when you launched?You would have to work incredibly hard to miss the fact that your product was now an addictive drug and you were drug pushing mobsters. Racketeering convictions all around please!The overprescription of opioids for minor pain was absolutely the most damning thing for many people I knew.Hopefully they charge the doctors too. After all, they're the ones with the legal duty to their patients. In my view, that's way worse because we're supposed to be able to trust our doctors to treat us in our best interest. No one really trusts pharmaceutical companies have their best interest in mind. Yeah...yeah..yeah...they arrested him...watch some slick lawyer get him off the hook after a "trial" that costs the US Taxpayer $2,000,000$ Go ahead and hire women that look like strippers to wine and dine doctors to sell more of your drugs and advertise your drugs directly to the gullible masses... but don't get too greedy and give doctors straight cash to push your drugs. $2 million in payments to 18,000 doctors works out to an average of $111. I don't know of bribery is gong to stick .oh god!  I shouldn't have read that.  I know what's happening but I don't like to think about it.The entire opioid crisis is a manufactured fucking scheme by the drug companies, a classic case of overdiagnosis and over prescription and deregulation writ large.And now dumbass Donald Trump is copying Ronald "the original Drug Warrior" Reagan with one of these bullshit "just say no" campaigns as a solution.If it didn't work for Nancy, it ain't going to work for you buddyCouldn't have happened to a nicer guy They wanted a head to hang for optics to coincide with the generous 56 thousand dollars the feds made available and he was the unlucky bastard.  Oh, he's Indian and a billionaire? Now I see why he was targeted.  Im sure he'll get like 2 years probation and no jail time. He's a billionaire, after all.They need to do something about the Sacklers otherwise nothing will change. 
If you donate hair, thinking it's gonna go to an individual going thru chemo or something, well, it nay, but usually not for free, it goes to a company who makes then sells the wig for thousands of dollars.  Meanwhile, you get nothing for donating the hair for free.  Random wig company sells the wig for thousands.  And the kid in chemo gets the wig if their insurance covers it that is.I saw a 60 minutes years ago, where skin from organ donors was being sold to a company doing penis enlargements while burn victims couldn't get any.  Removed my organ donor status the next day. Edit: [Relevant article from NPR](http://www.npr.org/2012/07/17/156876476/calculating-the-value-of-human-tissue-donation)The article clearly outlines the difference between organ and tissue donors. Tissue donation, which you are talking about, is very different from organ donation.Which is strange, because skin is an organ.Yeah, I guess it somehow gets lumped in with connective tissue in that regard. But definitely falls under the rules for tissue donation though.  maybe the distinction is that the entire thing at once is an organso you're just gonna let your organs rot in the ground? At least let some guy get a bigger cock. You're being selfishHahaha.  You'll just have to deal with the package that god gave you.  Sorry bud...I'm fine, but seriously, even if some company sells your organs or whatever, it has to be better than your guts just sitting 6' deep. I'm curious to see if you could will them for free to a person in need rather than Guts Inc.I refuse to have my body parts sold, so yes, they go into the ground.  If I knew that my organs/tissue were only to be used for victims, and not sold to the highest bidder for elective surgeries, yes I would be a donor.  However, that is not the case.  I'm just trying to understand your cost/reward calculus, here. If your organs go into the ground the cost is that people may suffer or die, but what is the reward? Effecting change through protest? Personal pride? Peace of mind?&gt; I refuse to have my body parts sold, so yes, they go into the ground. Tbh, if they are going to be sold it should be your surviving family who stand to gain from those transactions instead of just some the middle man company. That way everyone involved would benefit. Or, at least I hope everyone would... but at that point being dead what would I care one way or the other.Hell, such a incentive could help drive overall transplant organ supply too.(then again probably get ruined by some random psychos.)Then again, who am I to argue the point... not allowed to donate blood or organs due to random mad cow incidents in one of the places I lived in as a kid in the 90s.(1 damn imported cow... and not allowed to donate in the US)You don't want your heart, liver, kidneys, to be available if needed?  You would deny these organs to those who may die without them, purely to prevent the possibility that your skin may be used for an elective surgery?Correct.  If any of my parts are too be sold to the highest bidder, I will opt out.  You cannot sell organs like hearts, kidneys, and livers. While you can sell tissue organs are not allowed. So the majority of your body could not be sold even if they wanted to.Which is why Rockefeller got nearly ten new hearts, because the system is fair and equitable and not at all based on who has money.Donation means free not to give to a middleman to make money off something that was donated.Someone has to cut it out of you and put it in someone else.  Run the registry and deal with all the paperwork.  It's not full of volunteers.  You donate your organs and money changes hands to ensure they get used.Just curious, you'd rather have someone die than sell them your organs? All you're doing is removing one more *organ* from the market, making it harder for everyone that needs transplants.No judgement, you do you with your own body!&gt; Just curious, you'd rather have someone die than sell them your organs?Let me be clear (not the guy you replied to) I'd rather have someone die than have CORPORATION X sell them my organs or tissues without any remuneration to me or mine.If someone could benefit from my organs or tissues WITHOUT anybody or anything selling them, then by all means I'm all for it. Weirdly enough I like to be paid for my labor, too, though I do volunteer or donate money at times. Hell yeah! Decrease supply, that’ll DEF make it cheaper and easier for people who NEED (vs want) the organs to eventually get them! Hell yeah ! You’ve got it all figured out man, nice That's my plan I definatly don’t want to be part of someone’s penis when I die. I had mine on their because I had a relative who was actually helped by an organ donor’s death and ever since have been one. To know companies profit off this has completely change my viewpoint.Can I specify I want all my skin donated for penis enlargements?It’ll say “dick-skin donor” on your license.I'm totally OK with this.I understand why you'd do that. Not all people that donate organs end up with the same fate. My little cousin had to get a heart transplant when she was 7, she's 20 now and is in college, living, because someone donated their sons organs. The good that can come outweighs the bad possibilities, in my opinion. If anything, if more people donate, then those burn victims may have gotten what they needed because there would be an excess amount. The more in the market, the more chances it's used for the right thing. Just my two cents. So don't donate tissue.  &gt; Removed my organ donor status the next day.yeah this totally makes senseThat's kinda like everything.Some pieces of wood cost a total of $20. Someone buys the wood and builds a $100 rocking chair. You aren't purchasing raw materials, you're purchasing a worked product.The difference is that when you donate something, you assume it is being donated to the end consumer (the kid buying the wig), not the middleman to make money.This is why I never give in to those checkout line "charities." They're often scams where 99% of the money goes for "overhead."But in the case of a thousand dollar wig, I would like to sell my raw material for $10 at least. So find someone willing to buy it. Or start a business buying it and see how far you get.  Plenty of willing donors. &gt; So find someone willing to buy it. Or start a business buying it and see how far you get.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plenty of willing donors. If there are plenty of people willing to donate only to have their donations SOLD to the needy, then that 'plenty' doesn't need to include me. Yay!I have no idea how to start with a wig business. So I guess that's how far. Seems like a hairy business model, but I have faith in your abilities.The key is that it's a donation, you don't expect someone to make thousands if dollars off of you giving them free raw materials, that the end product goes to sick children...I have no problem with that, except that I want my family to get a cut when/if they sell my corpse.  I'm not just *giving* this luscious body away.same thing with blood donation - the people collecting sell the blood for $150 each to the hospitals.Gross.  Our for profit medical system is disgusting.  Im fine with whoever is involved with the donations covering costs, but that's it.Well, it's not so simple.  Like the Red Cross is non-profit so they do spend all their revenue to continue operating.  But that doesn't stop them from paying their CEO millions of dollars a year, giving their top executives expensive vehicles and shit like that.  Also something they often do is give all their family members positions in the organization with disproportionate salaries to the work they are doing.  Many people have become absurdly wealthy from operating a non-profit.  Is this a "Red Cross" vs. "American Red Cross" issue? Just curious, I've heard the American red Cross is a sperate organization that is criticized for irresponsible practices. But in general I feel like the more advertising an organization puts out the less likely your donations are going to a good cause.During Harvey you could see the Red Cross vehicles lined up outside the most expensive hotels in Houston. That's where they were staying.This is always the case with the Red Cross.  My mother worked there for 20 years before she retired, and she worked as an instructor for one of their CNA programs.  They decided to have a conference to tell the people in the area that they would be closing down some locations due to funding problems.  They had the thing in the capital city, paid for every attendee to stay first class a hotel.  They paid for food, transportation, and even drinks.  Instead of making concessions on their source of income which was no longer profitable, they blew a shit ton of money and then shuttered the sites completely.  One of which was 1 year into a 5 year lease.  The funny part, a few of those instructors formed a company and are now the direct competition with the local chapters still operating that training program.  Sounds like that episode of the office when they try and set up Michael to be the fall guy. "These are good people! They sent a limo all the way to Scranton to pick me up!"And the best part is it's a total write off for them anyways. If it's anything like government, might be because of hotel per diem and negotiated rates. Government rates can sometimes get suites cheaper than the smallest rooms.Not saying they're not a for-profit non-profit. At least they do something. Unlike Susan G. Komen. Can confirm, am government employee. We get the government rate, which is based on the city and state you're in, not the hotel. I've stayed at some pretty nice places while working for much, much less than I would pay if I wanted to stay there on my private time. In fact, we often seek those kind of places out, because if we're going to spend $75/night or whatever the rate happens to be, it might as well be a super fancy place we'd never be able to afford otherwise. as a gov, it's more like the hotels rail prices up to per diem. not checking the gov box has revealed lower rates. the hot spots dont care about gov cuz they can fill up at premium rates, san diego is like this and very convulsive with all the conventionsIf that's it I'd be fine with them putting their employees up at the nicest hotels in exchange for working in destroyed areas and dealing with bad stuff.What is the competitive pay rate for a CEO in a For Profit? It's a huge responsibility to run the Red Cross, what is a reasonable wage for the CEO to get paid.?[deleted]They have employees and they all have to compete with for-profit corporations for talent. Susan g komenGoodwill is the biggest scam out there.. dont even bother donating to them Tbf, you want a capable CEO. If the guys resumé allows him to work for 12mil at a normal company it's a hard sell to work at the redcross for 300k. He just needs to be worth the money.Here's the thing:You're a non-profit, and obviously you want to succeed. You look to hire a CEO, and you obviously want someone with experience. Except if you're offering a pittance in comparison to what that person would make as the CEO of a for-profit company, you're going to have a hard time attracting talent. Of course that looks bad, especially when you're the sort of non-profit that begs people for donations...but it would look a hell of a lot worse if some incompetent person was in charge of everything. The nepotism thing isn't exclusive to non-profits, either. Hell, just take a look at the White House. Yep. Go find a local charity. Meet the CEO. Ask why they are wearing fine clothes, driving luxury vehicles and sporting nice jewellery. I'm not talking about the Salvation Army or Goodwill or the food bank. Go meet the CEO of your local Ronald McDonald House, for example.A former friend from uni got a job with the Red Cross and was dispatched to Indonesia after the tsunami devastated the area. He was in a muslim-predominant area and noticed how sad people seemed in the days afterwards, so he, (this is where it gets unbelievable, but please stay with me) decided to throw a pig roast BBQ afternoon party for the locals. He spent quite a bit of money (Red Cross money that you donated to Tsunami Relief) on decorations, beverages (alcoholic and others) a band and a whole, roasted pig.Obviously, his efforts were tone-deaf, disrespectful, frivolous, foolish, and even ignorant of Muslim culture, inexcusable for "on the ground" management. What a tool. What a tool his boss was to authorize him spending that money or giving him the power to do so. I don't speak to this guy anymore and he makes me hesitate to donate to the Red Cross also.Non-profit is not necessarily selfless. It just sounds that way.To be honest though, having a strong charity requires strong organization, starting from the top. How would you expect to compete against profit-driven companies in finding CEO if you didn’t pay well and offer good benefits/some perks.Of course there are jerks, but people are not going to work for peanuts and good feelings when they could make 30x as much money across the street The Red Cross is a multi-billion dollar giant. One that manages to spend 89% on programs (which leaves 11% for overhead). You can't run a multi billion dollar company out of the back of a half running beat up VW Bus on the side of the road between Omaha and Lincoln. You just can't. A $600k-$1m salary with no stock option is paltry wage for a CEO of a massive multibillion dollar giant. Normally somebody with morals decides to do nonprofit work even though they could make more money. There's a bottom line they're going to accept. Any CEO that accepts a compensation which Reddit approves of is literally just volunteering his time or is really bad at his job Is that, in fact, normal?  Looking at the largest non-profits, are they run by people who are getting inadequate compensation because it makes them feel good?  I suspect this isn't the case, even among well performing charities.  Maybe some of the people on the ground are low paid if not volunteers, but the experienced and educated administration is probably manned by people who are getting paid what their education and experience can justify.CEOs in any business net bank cause they know how to run a business. Even in the poorest businesses, like dance companies, the CEOs make a million. But it's nothing compared to what they could make else where. Talent retention is a thing. It also covers the cost to have to store the item. They have to pay for the nurse, bags, needles, storage system and anticoagulant for the blood. 150 isn’t bad when you think about how many man hours it takes to move blood.Sure, that's all fine, and if that's all it is of course I don't have a problem with it, but if there's a ceo at the top of the chain making a 7 figure income off of something that was donated through charity, that's wrong in my opinion.The issue is if they only charged as much as it costs to screen, cleanly draw, package and transport the blood then we'd have a [worse shortage](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117954).  As it is, lack of blood is delaying some operations and surgeries.  Now imagine you didn't have talented people meeting with community organizers and trying to plan as many blood donations events as possible.  If you had a shoestring advertising budget and only non-profits were involved (who are generally less flexible than the private sector).  They'd only be able to go so far and handled only events of a large enough size.  You'd probably have fewer people, going into smaller more rural neighborhoods and bringing back small amounts of blood.  It all adds up though and helps alleviate the shortage.  Then why don't they allow the people donating blood to make a little money off their blood? You want to end shortages offer people donating a cut of the moneyMaking money off of blood donations as an extremely bad idea and increases the risk to the blood supply in every country where it's done.If you offer somebody $20 for a blood donation, you're going to get blood donations from the type of people who *reeeeeaaallllly* want to make a quick $20 and are content to lie on their screening forms to get it.Yes, all of the blood is tested.  However it's not that simple.First off, none of the tests are 100%.  Extremely early HIV infections for example are some of the hardest to detect.  Though it is extremely rare, and by extremely I mean maybe once in a decade, cases where people lie about their risk factors put the blood supply at risk.  The most recent case, in 2008, was somebody lying on the forums about their sexual history.http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/first-case-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion-traced-to-missouri/article_318e226b-e782-5fc2-8394-28ca274b46ce.htmlIf you add a monetary reward for blood donation, more people will lie.  That means more of these Fringe cases would be possible.Even ignoring that though, it would increase the number of contaminated samples that go through the system even if they are caught. That puts healthcare workers at more risk. Accidental needle sticks are fucking terrifying... Something I'm personally glad that I never had to deal with.  However despite all of the work which is done to reduce accidental sticks, they do still happen, and increasing the number of contaminated samples in the rotation would increase the risks.And even beyond that, as a third level... Even if the testing was 100% accurate, even if health care workers could never accidentally stick themselves with a needle, you still wind up with the problem of batch testing of samples.You see, they don't test all of the blood individually. There are multiple reasons for this... Cost, and patient privacy... But the core of it is that generally the blood is not individually tested for bloodborne diseases.  Instead they take a group of them, let's say 10 or so for the sake of discussion, and then they test that joint sample for the disease.  Instruments are incredibly sensitive, and even this far diluted they are still accurate.The thing is, if one of those 10 people has an infection, you don't really know which one it is.  Do the patient privacy, you really don't want to know specifically which one it is either... It's not the laboratorys position to tell a patient that they have HIV for example, that is something that needs to be addressed with their healthcare provider.  So in the end, you throw out all 10 and ban them from donating.  This may sound over-the-top, but these cases are exceptions... The initial screening questions, along with the fact that people have no reason to lie, helps self-select healthy donors.  So in the rare cases where this happens, they can error on the side of privacy.If we were to increase the incentives to lie, that would throw this entire system on its head.  Going back and retesting all of the samples, and then having to have an entire support structure set up where the patient can be contacted and put in contact with a healthcare provider while still maintaining patient confidentiality would be extremely costly....Long story short, we don't pay people for donations for many good reasons.  It's not just as simple as throwing $20 at somebody as a reward for a good deed, there is an entire structure of research which has been done into what works best for the blood supply.  Paying people would be a very poor decision.Very well argumented,  will keep this in mind for when this issue cones up again Bless your soul, kind, educated stranger You're then offering a perverse incentive to give blood that can abused by those we want blood from the least. Blood screening happens, and is pretty effective, but it's also helped by the fact that those lost at risk of serious blood-borne illnesses have no incentive to lie for their profit. I mean people get paid for donating plasma and it works out just fine.Hey! [Why you pay me for plasma but not for blood?](https://www.statnews.com/2016/01/22/paid-plasma-not-blood/)Plasma doesn't go directly into people. It is broken down and processed to kill viruses.  Paying for Blood or Plasma is legal, but no one in the US really uses blood that has been paid for.Lots of people with blood-born diseases donate plasma for money. "We" try to avoid an incentive for donating blood for money.Now you know the rest of the story, G!Paid Plasma is used for research, not donor/patient needs.It's bad incentives. Causes high risk people to donate more than low risk. Makes low risk less likely to donate.Ok, so its still a stupid model. If supply is an issue and the hospitals are paying that much, buy from the populace for half that. You have every college kid in the country hooked up like it was the matrix.I agree with you, but that's something they want to avoid.  Some people want to avoid a future where the poor are just being literally drained and farmed for blood/organs/etc.So instead we have ultra-rich people heading "non-profits"?  They might not be poor anymore if they get paid.  Further, it wouldn't be only the poor selling blood.  I don't need the money, but I still resent that some asshole is getting rich from my donation -- that's why I don't give blood.I work in a hospital blood bank.  We aren't getting rich from anyone's blood.  The overhead to run the department is ridiculous.  Blood isn't potato salad.  It absolutely, positively cannot go out of its storage temperature.  The testing that we have to perform is labor-intensive and expensive.  We make enough to cover our expenses and that's it.I can't comment on the Red Cross because our hospital does not use them.  Our supplier is only involved in blood banking, not other charity work.If nothing else, then some sort of incentive, like tax breaks. Sometimes I get offers for free tickets to baseball games, but I don't watch baseball. Still, I give blood b/c there's no other way for people to get the blood they need.What if we just spilled the blood of the ultra rich and use that? Like I said, I agree with you.  Though I will note that even though you are donating blood, there are a lot of expenses on their end, such as testing, supplies, storage, etc.  Yes, they are charging for it, but that doesn't make it all about making money. Though I still think we should be allowed to sell ourselves.Tell that to the GOPEasy there, Che.It ain't quite as much of a capitalist-swine scam as you think.For-profit medical has resulted in a pretty substantial amount of invention and improvement in care...as well as attract substantial talent to the industry.Yes, there are huge areas of improvements. But you know what you get when you throw out all babies with bathwater? Dead babies. That's what you get...dead babies.Just be a little more careful with your righteous indignation next time, Karl.Thank you, I haven't seen a response so full of douchecringe in a while, I needed the laugh.I actually work for a blood bank. Not one on the scale of Red Cross. We cover local hospitals that we essentially have contracts with. We tell them that we will collect enough to supply what they need. Should we fail to do so too much we lose that contract. We do not get money for the blood itself. We get money to cover what it cost us to collect the blood. Which is more than what most people would think. When you start talking platelets, plasma and double red cells you're looking at around $200 a kit. A machine that cost around $200,000. Add in the gas for the buses we run (for our bus about $200 a week). The FDA stopped allowing blood products that were to be given to a human recipient to be paid for. The reason they did this being you got tons of assholes lying about things to get money, shocker. We still get people who lie about having diseases and such. The plasma centers and such that are paying people are selling those products to cosmetic companies, research companies, etc. Roughly 38% of people are eligible to donate blood and roughly 10% actually donate. Whole blood you're looking at 1 pint from someone every 56 days. Takes five whole blood donations for one unit of platelets. Platelets last about 5 days after collection. We struggle to keep up with what our hospitals need. There are days I stand outside for hours asking people to donate. Being shut down over and over. I get the snide comments about not being paid for it. I get the excuses. That one person that comes on thanking us for what we do makes it worth it. That person telling us how a loved one survived because of what we do and the people who do donate. We have a man who donates every time he is eligible and brings his son. His son was born premature and needed blood products.I care so much about the work I do. I am 24 and have donated over 65 times. I donate platelets every 2 weeks. It's why I work there. It's a way to give back that cost nothing more than being stuck with a needle. Someone gets a fighting chance because of it. I try my best to make sure everyone who donates, or tries to, feels appreciated and has a good experience. We rely the most on our repeat donors. I urge everyone to rethink their stance on donating blood. Most places have a local blood bank. People die every day because the hospitals don't have what they need. We have donors who match with specific cancer patients, sickle cell patients, etc. The more people that donate the better matched the products can be. It can cut down on reactions the people in need suffer. Consider giving someone a chance to go home to their families. To be able to live their life. Forgive me for any mistakes made in my writing. The only mistake is lack of paragraphs, but I read the whole thing.Thank you for your work! I too have always been a fan of donation, and am a proud Gallon Club member (have donated more than that over the years, but I'm also anemic so it's hard to hit the minimum BP and heme levels every time!)I didn't know platelets were so fragile, do I just walk into a center and offer up those? My doc told me to stop donating due to anemia, but I never did have problems (I'm still fatigued all the time anyway even though I haven't donated in over a year.) Do platelets still require the minimum heme and BP levels?Thank you!Yes, you can go in and tell them you're interested in donating platelets. It doesn't drop your hemoglobin levels as much because you aren't losing as much in the way of red cells. The machine draws out a specific amount of blood then uses a centrifuge to pull what it needs. The platelets themselves and a bit of plasma to float them in. You only lose what blood the machine can't feed back safely.For us the requirements are the same. I struggled to keep my levels where they needed to be. That was part of why I started donating platelets. They have a very short shelf life. It's also better for the patient to receive single donor platelets versus platelets pulled from five different people. I know in our area we are always in need of platelets. The big things that could prevent you from donating platelets outside of the norm would be your actual platelet count and, for women, your HLA status. HLA is something that can change if a woman has ever been pregnant. The biggest draw back for most people would be time. It normally takes at least an hour. I would definitely suggest drinking plenty of fluids the day before and bringing something to entertain yourself with. Our center has Tv's and movies for donors to watch.&gt; Do platelets still require the minimum heme and BP levels?When &amp; where I did it, yeah. And even though I was getting most of my blood back, I still nearly fainted once and got pretty dizzy another time, so I see why they do it. If you do donate, and they ask you to do a double donation, decline the first time until you know how it hits you. I did triples for a while (apparently my platelet counts were AMAZING) and it was totally fine, but those last two times were a doozy and it scared me off from donating again. (yes, yes, I know, I need to go back...)The hospital charges the patient $800 per bag "1 blood please!"Because they process and test it.What's the overhead? GP might be 100% but how much does it cost them to collect, transport, and store the blood?This is why I do not donate blood.  When I start getting my cut then they can have my blood.You can **sell** your blood... mostly the plasma they'll pay for, but what you speak of *is* an option.My plasma put food on the table back when I was in college. It's a technicality but you can't sell bodily product so if you read the contracts they're paying for your time and answering survey questions while you are coincidentally hooked up to a plasmapheresis machine.&gt; you are coincidentally hooked up to a plasmapheresis machine."Oh *that?* I thought it was a lie detector test." LOL!!when people start getting their "cut" for their blood then you get junkies donating their HIV and Hep filled blood and lying on the questionnaires because the money is more important than donating to help people. Altruistic donors make the best donors. Alternatively selfish people generally always find a way to ruin a good thing. Blood is already tested for these things: http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-testingAlso, you can sell blood plasma already and there are systems set up to track people to make sure they don't go from plasma bank to plasma bank and don't donate too often, among other things, so why not expand that same system to blood?Plasma that is sold is not used in transfusions.  It's used by pharmaceutical companies to make reagents.You mean like the selfish people who make loads of money heading "non-profits" who go around begging people to give to their poor corporation?  Maybe if they didn't spend so much money begg...I mean marketing, they'd be able to pay for their raw materials.The screening issues can be resolved.  That's just an excuse to keep the gravy train rolling.I think you conceptually misunderstand how the screening process works. You take a quick survey then they collect the blood first, if it's acceptable after testing they can put it into circulation. If you paid people up front like you want and can't use the blood on the back end, then you've paid for nothing and lost money. That's not a sustainable system and I don't know how you couldn't see that becoming a huge problem for paying donors. Especially after what I've said about incentivizing money rather than altruism. I think the point is that it sucks and it is hypocritical to be the only link in the chain that is expected to have altruistic motives. You'd better believe the company that you're donating your blood to isn't altruistic, nor is the hospital selling your blood to the person in medical need, nor is the insurance company that the patient pays. Every other party to the transaction is happily taking their "cut" to the bank from your altruistic donation.If you cannot pay for the logistics, you cannot provide the service.Logistics cost money. If it helps for you to consider the cost of blood being $0 and everything goes to paying for logistic, think of it that way.If I remember correctly, the Billions that Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation donated to combat childhood disease all went to logistics. I don't think they paid any $$ for medicine. That had to be donated or bought by others.Logistics (staff, building, heat, insurance, AC, equipment, supplies, transportation) costs money...even if the product is free.And that's fair. It misses all the nuance of the situation, of which there is plenty, but it's a fair critique to have.They test it anyways. &gt; Altruistic donors make the best donors.If only one could donate blood without having to donate it to a business that is going to then sell it and make piles of money off of it.They don't make piles of money off of it though. They need the money to pay for equipment, tests and all that. A needle might not be expensive but I doubt you want to be jabbed with a used one. That piles up. The business is self-sustained, provides a necessary service and employs thousands. It's a non-profit and also supports the humanitarian services of the organization through revenue gained by lab testing and blood supply. It's not one of your "boogeyman" big businesses that the news tells you to be afraid of. It's a prestigious company to work for in the lab community and your understanding of it is simplistic and needlessly hysterical. The processing of the blood isn’t free even though it’s free to you. They have to have staff to collect the blood, test the blood, package the blood on top of capital costs. Sometimes you can get an ever so slight “cut” from promotions. I’ve got more MLB baseball tickets from donating that I’ve paid for with money.  Sometimes there are other promotions like movie theater or amusement parks to small gift cards. At the end of the day I would rather little Timmy get a chance to live if it means a corporation makes a little profit off of my blood. If no one donates lots of people will suffer. That's what I was thinking.  I don't care if a company profits off corpses, but they should be paying for those corpses and reselling them, not receiving them as charity.  I would bet the majority of the people donating the corpses didn't read or comprehend the line about the company being for-profit.  You don't have a choice.  Your three options are; burial, cremation, **Donate** to science.  At least in America (US). c'mon Cunningham's Law.Trick is to go missing at sea.  You donating to the fishes.And so I don't donate anything.  Either pay me or ban those involved from making money off of it.  Quilting me into giving my body away so some corporation can profit doesn't work.When you look at those options side by side, you have to ask, how much do I have to pay to donate my body to science?How is viking boat funeral not an option? :(burial at sea is an option if you fill out a form with the EPA ( see somewhere else in this thread)  but they don't allow the burning boat as you don't know where it will sink.Because like the Vikings, the practice is dead.relevant user nameAlso, a great band. Also relevant user name.How it should be, I'm a dude with awesome long hair and got it cut a while back and decided I wanted to donate it, until they told me it gets donated to a place that makes a wig, then sells the wig for thousands of dollars... so I get nothing, some random company makes thousands of dollars, and the kid with cancer gets nothing unless his insurance covers the wig... the insane to me. The lack of money *for me* doesn't bother me; it's the massive profit for those who sell the hair is disturbing though.Donate to Pantene's "Beautiful Lengths" program. 5000% less shady than Locks of Love. I feel the same way about being an organ donor. I totally agree with the argument for blood, but organs are different.  There is actual scarcity with organs, and it can be the difference between life and death for someone.  Blood is a commodity, and it's a renewable resource.  My actual organs could help someone live who would have died if I had not made that decision.  That makes the monetary considerations seem petty in that situation.But aren’t you giving it away when you donate it to science?The intention is not to donate it to someone to make a profit off of before it goes to research, the intention is to donate it *directly* to research.  If any middlemen are to be involved, and a profit to be made before it goes to science, that profit should go to my next of kin.  If I could sign up right now to *sell* my corpse to science after I die, I would.   I'm also okay with donating it directly to science with no profit motive for anyone involved. When you agree to donate your body to science, I guarantee nobody involved is being informed that your body will be SOLD to science for a profit that neither you nor your family will get any part of.This is *excellent* journalism by Reuters. They pieced together this story from a variety of obscure sources. And most importantly they do not sensationalize — they appreciate that there is a fine line between “selling body parts” and merely providing a distribution service, and intelligently analyze it.That's what Reuters does. They simply report facts and stay objective.So is there a tl;dr for worthwhile recipients of donations?&gt; Body brokers like Science Care offer the cheapest option: free cremation in exchange for the body. The deal: Science Care pays for the cremation of a donor’s unused remains and for returning the ashes to the bereaved family, usually after a few weeks.They find people willing to make the trade, and sell parts hospitals and schools.The article says that universities (presumably, medical schools) are in need of them. Donate to the medical schools directly.I came off with the exact opposite impression. I generally like reuters, but after ripping on a company for utilizing McDonald's model I couldn't take any of it seriously. Completely killed the story for me. If it explained why that was bad or how it negatively impacted people then maybe it wouldn't have, but as it was written it felt very sensational.I disagree.  I don't per se have a problem with the model, I have a problem with the ethics of some of these companies and their honesty.  They should communicate with people who donate bodies what will happen to those bodies and they should vet people who they sell body parts to.  If a Reuters journalist can go in and buy a guy's spine, while the parents where under the impression that it would go to research, then the company at minimum has no vetting process.  Add to that that the information provided with the spine and the two heads was insufficient for any research purposes and you have a pretty slimy company.Actually, it wasn't clear to me what happens to the body parts after they get sold by the company. They just talk about how medical schools are unable to compete and so are short on cadavers.Who's buying these body parts and why?Medical device companies, small colleges that aren't big enough for a medical school but still have human anatomy courses or a nursing program, medical research facilities. Reuters is great for that, but also why most people tend not to use them because the stories are too dry compared to all your cable news networks.Many of the comments (thus far) indicate a misunderstanding of the article.  It’s important to note that being an ‘organ donor’ is *DISTINCTLY* different from ‘donating your body to science’. This is mentioned in the article. That ‘organ donor’ box you check on your driver’s license-or anywhere-does not make money for anyone. The federal regulations that apply to this (very generous) gesture of donation strictly forbid the sale of organs/tissues for transplant.  The operative word here is ’transplant’. These codes are in place to protect both the donors and recipients from   illegal and unethical actions. This company/companies referred to in THIS  article Market bodies ‘donated to science’ .  This is very different. These organs/tissues are NOT for transplant.  These bodies ARE used for scientific research, training, and education.  These bodies do need processed, prepared, and otherwise shipped.  This costs money. Now, the level of profit made from these is in question.   To be frank, it’s like any other business.  Supply and demand come into play, as does simple business strategy.  I’m not a business person (I’m medical), so I hope someone will chime in on the business  side of it. If you’re interested in reading about how the bodies that are ‘donated to science’ are utilized, and the ethics involved, read ‘Stiff: The secret lives of corpses’.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff:_The_Curious_Lives_of_Human_CadaversSource: I’ve worked many years in the federal regulation and enforcement of ethical conduct in the medical field.  Before that I was part of a team involved in the transplantation of donated organs. Hearts/lungs, aortas, heart valves,  bone, etc. implanted into live patients who desperately needed the organs/tissues.  Before that was educated using organs/tissues from bodies ‘donated to science’. TLDR: details are everything. Leave the drama for your mama.  Please please be an organ donor. It’s not the same damn thing.  Based on this article I have the impression that if I were to donate my body. I’d rather donate my body directly to a medical school than through an intermediary.  Do you have any thoughts on these two options?I think the confusion is the point of the article. The people who chose to donate might have thought they're saving lives. Why would you chose to give something to a middleman for free when you know it will be sold for profit?&gt;  Please please be an organ donor. It’s not the same damn thing. Wait -- but if I sign up now for leaving my body to science, can I get a cut of the profits today?I mean, I know I *could* save the single parent of four starving children, but what if I could score $1,000 instead and have a great night in Vegas instead? Which life experience do *I* want?I highly recommend reading all of Mary Roach's books.Hilarious, tragic, terrifying, educational, and always entertaining!Holy shit, this is vile on a level I can't articulate. Kudos to Reuters for performing such thorough research on the subject and sticking to objective facts- and there are a lot of facts, all from straightforward sources. The article packs more of a punch for it. I wish more news outlets were like this. &gt; Holy shit, this is vile on a level I can't articulate.Why is this vile? How do you think people learn how to operate on you for a surgery?Hes calling it vile because a company is making a profit doing so. IE when you sign up to donate your body you think some med school gets it and learns surgery on you and thats that.Not some middle company makes a big profit off your donation and sells it to the school. Personally I understood there are some middleman and they by necessity have to be compensated but I do think its bad if the middlemen are making serious profits doing so.That's ridiculous. Why would anybody be in the business of managing the logistics of the cadaver pipeline if they weren't going to make money? Its a necessity to the medical world. Medical schools are not the only institutions that need cadavers to study. Medical professionals are in training their entire life. Especially if they are performing procedures.It's one thing to say well someone needs the inventive to do the work necessary. But it's another to see people cashing in big and capitalizing off of the *donations* of other people. Especially when people expect their donations (bodies) to be basically charitable good to go to help research. There is an implication there and it runs counter to the idea that you are actually donating your body to become a product for a company to sell. And I'm sure the businesses involved know that their profits depend on that implication as well, because a lot less people would be willing to donate their bodies A) To a for-profit business where it will be turned into products that are sold to medical schools for a large profit.. rather thanB) To "science"Again, people getting paid for their work (like happens in charities, non-profits, etc) does not necessarily mean getting rich off the charity of others.The vile part is that they don't reveal to donors what they are doing and that they don't seem to vet buyers.  It also seems like the medical documentation going along with the sold body parts is pretty poor and so wouldn't be very useful for research.  If they were actually professional about it I wouldn't have a problem with it.There was a time when journalistic integrity like this was commonplace. But, that was before ad revenue. Sensational headlines get more clicks regardless of the content of the article itself, and they can pay bad writers less to generate the same revenue. Are there any nonprofit options out there? I had fully intended to donate my body to science, but this seems wrong. The article seems to imply that you could donate directly to medical schools or academic institutions by stating such in your will. Our attorney gave us all the forms we would need to specify our donations and it's in our medical directives, as well.Here is a link to a DO medical school donation form. It's a private non-profit that uses the bodies to train medical students. A better google search would find more medical schools. https://www.dmu.edu/body-donor/There are tissue banks as well and I think most of this is covered under the below law.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Anatomical_Gift_ActI wish sky burials were legal here.  I want my whole body to benefit nature, not people.It's the least I can do.In the US you can do a sea burial in a simple weighted shroud. You have to go three miles out to sea and notify the EPA within 30 days. Very simple if you don't mind being fish food.https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/burial-sea&gt;notify the EPA within 30 daysGonna be hard from 3 miles out at Sea and under water. And also dead.There was a F-up off the Outer Banks a few weeks ago.  A body washed up on the beaches, and ultimately the body was IDd as one of these burials at sea.Did they send it back out to sea? What did they do with the body ?I'm assuming the at sea burial company redid the burial.  After the Dare County coroner signed offI’ve asked my fam, and in my plans, that I be buried under a tree in a minimally protective casket.  Let it wrap me up and drink my starfire.In the US there are body farms you can be donated too. They stick you outside in various conditions and study how you decompose. I'd love a sky burial. I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to have my un-embalmed corpse buried under a sapling since that option doesn't seem possible. I want people to eat the fruit I've helped produce.[Capsula Mundi - Burial Pods](https://youtu.be/fHkZZNlxLzo)So if I want to donate my body, I donate directly to a university right ?Yes. A university's practices will be a lot more ethical, and they set their budget to break even rather than turn a profit. Yep good to know, I plan on donating my body and the thought of someone using it to make profit is grossing me out. That’s the message I’m getting as well.What am I reading. This article is hard to process. Is it badly written or am I resisting the infoIt's a special report meaning it's an investigative piece presented sort of like a written documentary so it's not in usual "Here-Are-All-The-Facts" form.  Don't feel bad.  TL:DR An enterprising couple realized that there was a disconnect between people/corporations that require human parts and corpses for research and commercial use and people who want to donate their body and/or can't afford a traditional funeral (which costs average $7000 US). So they set up a for profit company, heavily marketed it, then made millions selling it to a private investment firm. The consequences are thousands of people who donate their body have no idea it's for profit, may not benefit society, and medical schools are forced to compete for cadavers with a private enterprise. The mentality behind being an organ donor, blood donor, or even donating your body's to science needs to change.  As it stands the everyone makes money on it except for the family of the person who donates.  At the vary least it should cover there funeral costs.The report does say that the incentive for donating to a private company like the one here is they cover all the costsMy husband and I specified this in our final directives. Our attorney provided us with all the necessary forms we would need to fill out and present to medical staff. No funerals and no expense.My ex-MIL did it. Several months later, the family received a small box of ashes. They're planning something next year but it's not going to be a funeral. More like a week-long party in Ireland to celebrate her life.That's an Irish funeralThis isn't new. The company building the panama canal did this during the construction phase.https://thesilverpeopleheritage.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/the-panama-canal-death-tolls-another-revealing-look/FTA: &gt; These estimates range from somewhere around 22,000 to 82,000 deaths. There were so many bodies to dispose of that the Railway officials began to treat them as a commodity. The Railroad pickled the corpses of the nameless dead in wooden barrels and sold them to medical schools. Income generated from the cadaver business was sufficient to maintain the Railroad’s own gleaming new whites-only hospital.I can't bring myself to donate when if I were to use blood, I'd be charged up the ass for it.  The blood I donate should be donated to the victim with minimal charges for maintenance and testing.  Otherwise I am just giving the corrupted medical industry more money for nothing.How many people do you think are involved in the harvesting, transport, cleaning, testing, storing, equipment maintenance, delivery, and administration of the blood you donate?Too many, and it is extremely inefficient and overpriced.One needed but rather undignified aspect of donating your body to science is having it put in a field or shallow grave to study decomposition so that police can determine how long a body was dumped.They should change their  name to McGhoulies.That's the most American story I've read in a whileThis might seem distasteful....I get it.  But they claim that the bodies are now cheaper for researchers to get.  Really, this sounds like a capitalist success story.  "Invisible Hand" and all that jazz.Maybe someone will want my body when I'm dead  *sigh*People need to do more research before donating, and that goes for all charities. Letting corrupt charities thrive will cause more corrupt charities pop up.I don't have a problem with this. The dying person is donating something valuable-training for the next generation of physicians-an altruistic motive that may give them some comfort in their final days. The family is getting a benefit in not having to pay for a cremation for the parts of the body that aren't used.  The company is providing a valuable service connecting needs on both sides of the equation in a business that not many people would want to be involved in on a daily basis.  A little profit is not out of line here.  If they are price gouging for having a monopoly, that would be different.Is it too late to lease a head and a few arms and legs for my Halloween decorations?I could *really* have done without the hamburger analogy.  Yuck. Well yea, who the fuck is going to do that job for freeThe mother of a friend of mine wanted her body donated to science.Imagine his shock when he found out that he'd have to pay thousands of dollars to **donate** his mother's body.He didn't have the money, so she was cremated instead as it cost about $2000 less than what it would have cost to "donate" the body.It sounds like this company is trying to solve that. They offer disposal of the body for free, according to the article. I didnt think we could sink any lower as a society but here we areWhat do you mean? This society already thinks I should have to sell my body just to be able to afford rent. I'm not surprised it feels entitled to making money off of it when I'm dead, either. Similar thing happens when you "donate" blood.  It gets sold for $1000 a pint!Not if you donate directly to the hospital. You can go someplace like St Jude Children’s Hospital and directly donate whole blood or platelets. isn't this is the same as what was alleged on planned parenthood where they are accused of profiting from aborted fetus? Planned Parenthood was asking for reimbursement for the costs associated with preparing and transporting fetal tissue, so essentially they were breaking even. It seems the company in the article was after pure profit with little consideration for ethics. 
The article presents the backlash against wealth in Gilded Age as public anger.  That was certainly true as described, but another take on this is that the public was trying to fix a problem before it grew out of control and didn't do enough.  Arguably, this Gilded Age continued beyond breaking the monopolies and led to the Great Depression.  [This graph shows income inequality against major events of the 20th century and where we are at today.](https://imgur.com/a/86Qll)That could be more detailed. There are dives at the dotcom bust/911 recession, black friday in 1987, the heat up of the Vietnam warWhat happened on black Friday in 1987?Another recession, stock market tanked, banks closing.. my bad, it was actually called Black Monday. All happening during the savings &amp; loan crisesThe Great Depression was caused by loose credit rules and the response of 50% increase in government spending by Hoover and FDR running against, but then continuing that policy.Contrast that to the Depression of 1920 caused by the WW1 economy and massive government borrowing, the response was to cut taxes and spending with the Depression over in 18 months. Funny how they say they're "giving back". Donating to museums/galleries isn't quite the same as helping people with education, medical costs and access to care or infrastructure-if money was going to these things I would actually consider it "giving back". Donating to art galleries just feels like a total cop out. Sure, it allows them to say they "did something" for a community but the people in that community who are hurting the most (or even in general) don't end up any better off because their museum got a new Rembrandt or had a special showing of local artists. Worked at an outpatient clinic as a RN in a low socioeconomic area around NJ/NY. We would often have people coming in that would find themselves in a situation like having to decide between buying their kid medicine or being able to pay for food for the week or buying a bus ticket home for themselves + their child. Fuck that socialist single payer stuff, though.. I don't want to pay for them.. the lazy sods! Amirite?  (/s .. /s!!! I'm being sarcastic!!  I only feel like I have to say that because these are the kind of statements I've actually seen idiots write.)"Fuck you, I got mine" - the actual life philosophy of about half the nation.Art is an excellent way to launder money for your shady dealings.It's a tax write off. Spend 300k on piece of art. Get it appraised for 1.5M. Donate to museum. Get a write off based on appraised value.  Yep, we pay for their generosity as taxpayers.as soon as donation don't get tax write offs we'll see who they really are.Most of their "philanthropy" is going to conservative think tanks.The best way for them to give back is for them to pay more in taxes, significantly more (because who the fuck really needs a billion dollars, let alone many billions). But they just bought themselves a Congress to make sure that they don't have to be that generous. These people are fucking hoarders, and have the logic of hoarders. They are disgusting and should not be venerated or feted.Yeah, there's a bit of a difference between a token donation and using your wealth to fund literally thousands of public institutions It's almost like they think "culture" is an exclusively physical phenomenon.  Like, they figure that somehow material wealth is representative of the will of the population.(Mostly intended as humorous sarcasm.  But also damningly true. =P)&gt;Funny how they say they're "giving back". Donating to museums/galleries isn't quite the same as helping people with education, medical costs and access to care or infrastructure-if money was going to these things I would actually consider it "giving back". &gt;&gt;Donating to art galleries just feels like a total cop out.It's way more than than that; [it's a fucking tax dodge.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/business/art-collectors-gain-tax-benefits-from-private-museums.html) "Giving back" the same way Trump "donated" his first month's salary to the national park service... after slashing its budget... and now trying to raise the entrance to Yosemite to 70 bucks a car, making it something poor families won't be able to even experience...Yes, and wealthy people often donate to these causes because:- It's great PR and maybe you get your name on a building.- It creates a public dependency on private capital, which equals political power.- Definitely tax deductible and accountant-approved.So of course the US needs to rush through those tax cuts to cement their ownership of every last dime.They don't have enough you see!  Look, if Barron von Moneybags the IV makes another billion dollars, he'll give you a coupon for 25 cents off the purchase of 2 or more packages of deli meat.  We can all save a bunch on deli meat, if we just give him all of the money.Don't act like you're not benefiting from this too!But we're just a few more percentage points away from the rich deciding to share!&gt;So of course the US needs to rush through those tax cuts to cement their ownership of every last dime. As opposed to the government cementing ownership of it?Lol How horrible, imagine if the government had money to spend on schools, roads, healthcare, police and fire protection...Nah, better to let that one person live in god-emperor like wealth on top of a pile of gold. That's freedom. For YOU! Somehow?Yeah, that money is far better put to use in giving gifts to Iran for no reason to help them develop their nuclear program they *totally weren't going to develop*.hmm, life sucks but I'm real glad they opened Yet Another Art Gallery! It helps so many people!Idk, although they are making more charitable contributions than before, I feel like opening art galleries to the public falls a little short (not that art isn't important). With that much money they could educate entire states. If they're feeling nervous, then that's good. They should be. I'm interested to know the statistics of where the 98% of that wealth ends up. Art should only count if it is permanently placed in public galleries...With a current debt of $20tn, if the gov't stole all of their money, it would only knock us down to $14tn in debt...and we'd still have a deficit.Deficit &lt;&gt; debt. They aren't the same thing. I know. My comment meant we'd still continue to increase the debt with the deficit.Current deficit is about $1t, so in the hypothetical, we would indeed no longer have a deficit if we seized all of that money. Except all the tax revenue  generated by the money would also be gone.....foreverIf the companies weren't tax evading/reducing, maybe there would not be a deficit. If corporate tax revenue vs GDP stayed consistent through the 20th Century and up until now, we'd have annual surpluses. I was obviously being hyperbolic. Yeesh. That's not how any of this works."Deficits don't matter" - Dick CheneySave your breathe.  They like to think all problems would be solved by taking what is not theirs. It ain't theirs--without stealing the benefit of our labor, they wouldn't have it.Don't worry, we'll be burning down some mansions soon enough.I would like to know where all your money comes from and where it goes.   Doesn’t my statement sound creepy?There are countries with publicly available tax records and they do fine.So... No, I don't think it does.Ok so where and how did you make your money last year.  How much did you make and how much of that did you spend.  And what did you spend it on. Please be specific. Also how Much did you save and where did you save it Also can I get this info from anyone that downvoted my comment. That's simple. The rich take from the working class.So sad you think that....what did bill gates take from working class....an operating system.Pretty sure that's what he *gave*Both actually. Um okIt's sad you think the workers deserve nothing and the rich deserve everything.Its sad that you completely dodge his question.You are delusional.  Workers have more currently than at any point in history.  Everyone has more than at any point in history.  You're dad had to walk to school up hill in the snow both directions, but he also paid for college on a summer job and bought a house when he was done. Sounds lovely. I'd give up the iPhone for it.  Wow so progressive! Workers are also getting a smaller and smaller share of the productivity pie; look up CEO vs Average worker pay sometime if you want to remove your head from the sand. Why would that be creepy?Ok tell me how much you made last year,  how did you make it and how and where did you spend and save itSure, I made a hundred thousand dollars that I found in a banana stand, and I spent it on a prosthetic arm that I could use to scare kids into making wise choices.You didn't answer the question, friend.When do we get to reset the monopoly board? Looks like this game is already over...Who is really controlling the global nuclear stockpile is the real question. (((Central Bankers)))  and (((Globalists)))  And yet people are still starving to death, diseases are still killing people with no funds for research in some cases, and you still want a fking tax cut. Do you really think they care about *other* people?  No I really don’t until they’re on the brink of death. My grandmother was rich and when I went to visit her she said this little dollar fan that I gave her she had by her bed was worth a million dollars to her because it was so hot at night and what not. Was she not rich enough for AC?I should have said she was at the hospital bed Oh that makes more sense. And my joke is no longer funny, it's just douchey. Sorry about your grandmotherDid she give you the one million dollars?Studies show that the wealthy are less empathetic than the poor, whether they're driving a car or serving in Congress.https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/21/how-can-you-tell-if-someone-is-kind-ask-how-rich-they-are/Those people shouldn't suck.It’s already too late.Yes, and with the era of computer algorithms, they plan on taking a lot more.Caution: You can't stay rich when there is no money circulating. Sure you can, rule by coercion instead of agreement.Let's say I have all the money, and you have none.  I'll offer to let you clean my house, and in return, I'll give you enough food to live.No need to bring money into this.Worked for robber barons before, can work again.You're argument is basically the current state of global economics. It isn't sustainable. Is it sustainable for the next 20-30 years? If so, most billionaires are golden. The endgame of capitalism is the death of everything.for most they figure they won't live long enough to see it.I don't think they even consider that. They'd still do the exact same shit if they knew for a fact we'd all be dead in a year.The endgame of literally anything is the death of everything.Yeah, but not *intentionally*.Don't forget that you, as a rich man, don't necessarily have the food yet, you may only have the money to buy the food. And if you have all the money, or most of it, then the purchase power of that money will go down and you'll have to pay more to buy the food that you offer me in  exchange of you letting me clean your house.In other words, most of the rich are rich because for some reason we submit to this crooked system.Who says i need to buy the food? I can guarantee that i simply did not claim all the money in one go. There are an abundance of bartering methods and tools available in order to produce food, or even other means of payment, and get services in return. On top of that, i can accept more valuables upon allowing people to use my commodities and thus create a perpetual cycle all while keeping my full wealth to myself.Edit : a letterSure you can, you just have to sear all the sides and then cook em low n slow in a cream sauce. *Eat the rich* The article asks at which point we’ll strike back. It’s already happening with Bitcoin. Occupy Wallstreet in its finest form. The Revolution is coming...Technology is going to give the rulers an iron-clad grip on power.  AI is going to be able to detect pockets of dissent early on and stamp it out before it has the opportunity to become a larger movement.  It's going to make revolution impossible and permanently enshrine the super-rich in power.  They believe this is their entitlement.Replace the work force with robots and they won't even need us to produce wealth anymore. We're talking Harkonnen-style dictatorship here.No it's not. Lay off the weed.have you seen the murder bots? do you really think the average american is capable mentally or physically of fighting them?That's a job for methheads. Miss the good old days when wealth was equally distributed and life expectancy was 40something something, seize the means of production. it works every time!Well unless you've got another suggestion, we should give it another shot, because this shit isn't gonna fly.It is going to fly wether we like it or not.Enjoy the benefits it gives though, loving standards are the highest they have ever been and the world is more peaceful than it’s ever been every year we are showered with more technological luxuries.A rebellion could never work in this day and age, the troops in the millitary are just as much programmed as they are trained, they control all information and all fire power.But the museums in five hundred years will be amazing!Centralized banking. here are the countries that currently do not have oneAfghanistan.  Iraq.             Sudan.Libya.Cuba.North Korea.  Iran.  Seems most if not all of these have some sort of conflict.  i find the coincidence interesting...in that i do not believe in coincidence.          Oh here we go with the "Central Bank" libertarian conspiracy theories.North Korea and Cuba both have central banks, the difference is that banking there is a public utility rather than private for-profit.Iraq has one as well (privatized), ever since Paul Bremer launched his neoliberal economic plan after the invasion in 2003.What those countries have in common, with the exception of Iraq for the most part, is that they didn't kowtow to US imperial interests.They didn't open up their countries policies in lockstep with us economic and geopolitical interests.It's not just banks dude.bottom 90% = $33,068; (ii) top 10% = $295,845; (iii) top 5% = $448,489; (iv) top 1% = $1,260,508; and (v) top 0.1% = $6,087,113.2017, it is obviously even more polarized than this.Hungry?

We have less people living in poverty than ever.  I'd say most of humanity. We also have absurd income inequality. The two aren't one in the same of course. But I wouldn't call today a golden age for the average Joe.When was your golden age for the average Joe and in what country? We talking after WWII?  I mean yes blowing up a large part of the world and still maintaining most of your manufacturing ability is good.  Should we have another world war perhaps?   Anyways when is the best time for the average Joe?[The Black Death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, peaking in Europe between 1347 and 1350 with 30% to 65% of the population killed. It reduced world population from an estimated 450 million to between 350 and 375 million. It took 80 and in some areas more than 150 years for Europe's population to recover. From the perspective of many of the survivors, however, the impact was much more benign, for their labor was in higher demand. English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. **For English peasants the 15th century was a golden age of prosperity and new opportunities.** Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. A century later, as population growth resumed, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_of_the_Black_Death)/sYeah, nothing like a good global war or plague to make your labor in more demand.  If you live though the disaster I'm sure you'll find yourself in a better situation.So I guess hope for a world wide plague and global conflict.  Should be good times.&gt;When was your golden age for the average Joe and in what country? Did I say that we had one?I disagree this is beyond a shadow of a doubt a golden age for the average joe, the average joe is going to live longer, with more freedom and access to technology, with less violent than any point before.Who decides what that poverty level is?http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/05/news/economy/poverty-world-bank/index.htmlIs CNN fake news for you?

I apologize if I took your comment out of context. something something fuck capitalism abc123 generic replygive.me karma or give me deaththat generalization is often based on the most destitute places in the world avoiding the issue of regional inequality. Not to mention that people barely living above the world bank's definition of poverty is not Gilded. Unless you mean painting a thin coat of gold to make something crappy look better. He's not wrong though.  He made a completely factual statement and is getting downvoted.In what kind of dream world are you living to suggest something like this? Right now even the middle class is shackled by debt that they will work to for the rest of their lives. And it's still going worse every year...&gt;Right now even the middle class is shackled by debt that they will work to for the rest of their lives.When is your utopian time this wasn't true?  I don't know.  Don't buy a 2000sq mcmansion?If more people would worry less about how much money other people have and work hard on improving their own lives, they might just find out it works. Someone will always have more money than you, always have, always will.Want to stop making people rich? Stop buying $1000 phones (LOL!), buying shitty music from shitty people (Kanye, etc), stop watching shit TV, stop using so many petroleum based products, etc.You are thinking of a meritocracy where hard work is rewarded equitably, the U.S. doesn’t have that. But congratulations on buying into the bootstrap victim shaming mythology and missing the point.That is nearly enough to give everyone on the planet $1.  Could you imagine the quality of life improvement if $1/ person was given to a country still struggling with preventable diseases?1$ even in the poorest parts would do next to nothing long term, there are real systematic problems there that cant be fixed for 1$. In a lot of regions you are just handing their money to the corrupt politicians or war lords who made the problems in the first place.If you want to make a difference look at bill gates, with his money he has done a hundred times more than what you plan would have done even if you gave everyone a 10$ bill.Right, and if we had a population of benevolent wealthy elites in power that took their cues from Bill Gates, we'd all be better off for it (besides the people that would benefit from the huge amount of money that he DOESN'T spend altruistically). Unfortunately, the Gates' and Buffets' of the world are few and far between, because most of the people on the planet who obsessively hoard wealth, just because they can, don't give a fuck about you or me. They have no qualms about doing whatever they can to be as rich as possible, and most of the time that involves doing things that deliberately deprive the working class of their opportunity to make money. Automation means that, pretty soon, human labor will become obsolete, and the driving force behind that is rich people who want to maximize profits by cutting out the biggest expense in business, which is labor.Labor is not the biggest cost in many many many businesses.And just look up Gates’s giving pledge, they are not few and far between but increasingly common.And I am absolutely 100% certain his spending is somehow a tax evasion scheme.It’s not, minimzing taxes is a known and perfected art, there is no need or benefit to giving away so much money.Those are dirty thoughts around these parts friend. Are you some kind of communist or something? You're supposed to be against that kind of thing and confuse it with government sponsored mass murder so that you keep paying your dues to the wealth hoarders without question.There are 6 trillion people on the planet? Cool statistic bro.
Why would the evil gubmint use crisis actors? The theory that no one was was actually killed or injured would require the cooperation of thousands of people, including first responders, hospitals, health insurers, hotel owners and employees, bystanders...I mean, come on. Think it through. Edited to add: Not to mention medical examiners, funeral directors, cemeteries, bereaved families... And how exactly did it go down? The government sent 600 or so people to a concert with fake blood bags and instant gore makeup to apply realistically onto themselves when they heard the shooting (of blanks) start? Do you suppose any of the other 21,000 people at the concert would have seen that? Or were they ALL IN ON IT?? Good grief.&gt;Think it through.This is where you lose people.But no, you see, these people won't talk because they signed NAs! Because we know no one has ever spoken out ever signing one of those before!Even if you are a conspiracy nut, isn't just using your mind control drugs on one guy to get him to go crazy so much cheaper, simpler and easier to get away with? I mean Mel Gibson did a whole movie about it. Real dead bodies are the best propaganda tool ever.I remember an SNL sketch, which didn’t live up to its potential in my opinion, where they had trolls on a TV show where they got called out by the people they attacked, part of me wishes there was a show that called out these fuckwits. Like to Catch A Scumbag. Every time they're unmasked it's the same story - absolute bottom barrel losers who have failed at every aspect of their lives, and who have become disconnected from society and basically self-brainwashed themselves with far-right conspiracy shit.These are people that barely interact with the world they claim to know all the secrets about.The guy that "investigated" the pizza place by shooting the ceiling a few months ago -- he fit the profile of these losers to a T.It's always something like this, -- no job, no girlfriend, no wife, no children, 20s-30s, less than $100 in the bank, living with parents/on welfare, pretty much the only thing they own is a laptop/phone with an internet connection. and maybe a gun or a car.edit: which is why I think they go crazy. they have literally nothing going on, nothing to lose, nothing to live for. so they create their own reason to breathe by stalking these people or whatever the hell you wanna call itAnd to show how deep the pathology goes, that guy still didn't change his mind about the conspiracy.  He simply believes that he was misled about when and where it would be taking place.  He thinks he just got tricked.  He referred to it as "bad intel" because of course he views himself some sort of soldier receiving "intel" and "missions" from some command structure.  Of course when he says that he means the random 4chan posts that he'll believe and do whatever they say.He still totally believes the conspiracy, even after throwing away his entire life to have a look in a pizza parlors stock room.  It may have even made him a stronger believer."Damn these guys are better than I thought.  They sealed up an entire child sex dungeon and made it look like a stock room before I got here.  They must have connections that go right to top to pull that off."Guarantee these are the sorts of thoughts that idiot has all day.If someone got injured I would probably be singing a different tune, but goddamn that just makes me feel sad for the guy. Sounds like he's have some psychosis.Problem is that he had that psychosis with a firearm. That's a no-no and he needs to be locked up, in a mental institution. I hope that's still a thing, instead of going to prison or whatever. Someone like that would rather go to prison because they don't think they're crazy.He's a felon now, so no more (legal) guns for him.There's a point with paranoia where no matter what evidence they are presented with, they just double down on their insanity.They just roll with thr assumption that anything that doesn't reinforce their delusions was planted by the Lizard people.Jesus your hitting close to home....I knew (and very regretfully) dated someone like this many years ago, we met through a protest group and I watched his mental health degrade into someone delusional and unreasonable. He was an alcoholic who lived at home, would frequent 4chan's /k/ and /b/ boards and had knives all over the house (including one taped to his bathroom wall) because he *needed* to be prepared for when "The government comes knocking." He was convinced he was on an FBI list for his "sci-op" and "hacking" skills (i doubt he even knew how to code) when in reality we just hung out on the same irc server that actual small time hackers and scammers did. He was also dead convinced a second Revolution/Civil War was on the horizon, where the entire populace would be fighting in the streets with guns and knives-and *he* was going to lead it...He never explained how or why this would even happen. He would literally do anything he was told if it was called  a "mission" or an "OP" and would plan extensively for anyway it could lead to violence-Because he hoped it would.  I had made plans to move to the same city he lived in for work before we broke up, those who got him to do "missions" told him my move was actually a political plan to have him forced out of the protest group, which he believed immediately and now convinced I was out to ruin his life and reputation.  He somehow managed to join the the army and I was free of him for a while...until he got too fat in basic training (which STILL boggles my mind-I heard through a friend he constantly sneaked snacks into the barracks) and was discharged...A **lot** more happened with him but I'm paranoid about this somehow getting back to him, he's honestly scary and I consider him a stain on my life...I hope he's doing better mentally and am scared shitless of what he could be like now if he isn't.PSYOPs. Its short of psychological operations.I'm glad you got out alive.Honestly in this case its probably sci-ops... like science fiction ops.This is an article where the person making threats is a woman in her 60s, disabled, http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-reg-sandy-hook-harassment-sentenced-20170328-story.htmlNo, they have a job but they convert all potential prosperity into GUNZ AND AMMO. Then they tithe 10-20% to their fuckwit church, and of course they are paying alimony and child support because their phony moral/religious guidance got them 2 divorces, a trailer house, and 4 dumbfuck future garbage kids.source: I am highly generalizing, stereotyping, etc...This is more cathartic for me than it is meant to contribute to a meaningful conversation.And this is why I can't even laugh at them. Comedy should punch up, these guys are about as down as down can get.They go from being pitiable to being despised when they start hurting others. Like the parents of Sandy Hook victims or survivors of Vegas.Rules are made to think before you break them. I'm good with punching down *hard* in this instance.It's crazy how the right in this country has gone all in on conspiracy politics. Conspiracy theorists used to be non-partisanThat's what Hillary *wants* you to think while Obama organises an army of 1000000 Mexicans to force tolerance and free healthcare on us!Its because the right has spent decades lying and denying reality, so now they have so little grasp of reality that stuff like tgis takes hold easily.can you blame them though? they are raised in the cult of the Republicans. but the older you get, the more uncomfortable facts you learn about. the only solution is to insulate yourself from every fact that could make you question this cult. everyone thus is against you. scientists? part of the conspiracy against you. teachers? same. the media. Hollywood. etc etc etcI remember on some sites it became a running joke to compile a list of (I forgot the exact naming) "people that are conspiring against republicans and thus america" and every time another story came out about denying something they got added to the list. This is during the 2012 election back before crazytown became normalized and it had only been a joke, not elected.Jay and Silent Bob do something similar with Internet trolls, going to each of their homes and kicking their asses.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsXKAtpLm4IAll you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball-lickers. We're gonna fuck your mothers while you watch and cry like little, whiny bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who is makin' the movie... we're gonna make them eat our shit, then shit out our shit, and then eat their shit that's made up of our shit that we made 'em eat. Then you're all you motherfucks are next. if you do this to Victims... you are a piece of Garbage. Actually, what they're doing is probably criminal. Particularly if the victims get a restraining order and those shitstains violate it.It baffles me that people fall for the likes of Alex Jones. His show is just one long commercial for supplements and shit his company makes. But then I remember that there are way too many people who think the earth is flat and the moon landing is a conspiracy. Jet fuel melts metal beams, amiright?You are baffled because you haven't internalized how many dumb motherfuckers there are walking around on this planet. You probably don't hang out with them, so you forget they exist.  Hundreds of millions of people have very low IQs and are dumb as dirt.  I wouldn't even say it's IQ related, there's many otherwise very intelligent people that fall into this trap.  IMO it's more to do with emotional and mental health.&gt; I wouldn't even say it's IQ related, there's many otherwise very intelligent people that fall into this trap. IMO it's more to do with emotional and mental health.It's about stroking your own ego.Conspiracy Theories make you think you're doing something REALLY important, by doing absolutely nothing at all.If you're a stupid-loser, they make you feel like a smart-winner, because you "know" things the "average" person doesn't.  You can look down on people, those stupid sheep.  Also, the reason you're a loser is because what's the point of trying if they "man" is going to keep you down?If you're smart, well they just play to your intelligence.  Of course of YOU know about the conspiracy, ALL journalists are idiots &amp; in on the scam.  Only someone  as SMART as you can figure it all out!  You see this a lot with 9/11 &amp; ant-vaxxers... Educated people that believe they are smarter than the so-called experts.    And it's just a routine foul-ball catch for the mentally-ill.I suddenly realized that Ego would be a great cat name. It fits the stereotypical expectations of cat personality and you can tell people that you love stroking your Ego and other such sayings.Utterly random, but trueBattle Cat is the alter Ego of Cringer.I was going to say yes until I realized I literally have a retarded cat.Well said. The people who engage in conspiracy theories are never above average I've noticed...Conspiratrds are more like a Venn Diagram and each one of them are different.  It runs the gauntlet from low intelligence, ignorance, mental illness, prejudice, racism, feeling vulnerable, religious and hating the other gender.It's all highly narcissistic though.  It's a way of feeling achievement while having achieved nothing, and to feel intelligent without having to possess intelligence.It's all about them being special, when they're not.  They can't have a special house, or a special spouse, or a special car, or a special job, they have nothing else special about themselves to feel proud about, and they're likely dependent on other functional people to take care of them, but they can know the Special Truth.That is a big one, if you go to r/conspiracy right now you will see a Corey Feldman posts.  Are they patting themselves on the back and saying how happy more people are finding out what is going on?  Nope they are angry with the people and dismissing them.  Here is the thread https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78umgj/suddenly_all_of_reddit_believes_cory_feldman/It is about people that think they are smarter than they really are. These people have to feel superior and stand out. thus they adopt certain conspiracy theories that make them feel like only THEY are smart enough to see "the truth" and 99% of the planet are sheep that are too dumb to see. These types of people could be really smart or just average and below, you are right about that. Exactly. People who think they’re smarter than they really are. And from what I’ve noticed? A disproportionate number of conspiracy theorists are actually fairly smart. They’ve been told their whole lives how smart they are. And their intellligence is their defining characteristic. It’s something we all do, to some degree. We take our “best” quality, and we attach greater significance to having that quality. It’s good-looking people thinking that how good-looking you are is a measure of your worth. It’s athletic people thinking that how athletic you are is a measure of your worth. Etc. Etc. And in small doses? That can actually be a good thing. It’s good for people to feel good about themselves. It’s when they get all up in their own butts about it that they become insufferable.It's not IQ related. At least with the infowars/Jones crowd.I have talked to several people on here who have fathers that listen to Alex Jones, like take him for his word and these guys are fucking engineers and doctors and all that.It's amazing the scope of people that get taken in by a conman. It's almost admirable of Jones that he can do that. Where and who you grow up with is huge too. For the most part my dad is an intelligent guy, but man does he go down the rabbit hole when it comes to politics. When I was young I followed him because how could my smart dad be so wrong? After reading multiple books by Glenn Beck and that crowd I became a bit of a puppet. Watcgex Fox News every day. I can't tell you what changed me, I don't remember any more really, but one day all this stuff I believed just... Didn't click. These people who "preached the truth" only kept getting proven wrong time and time again, and it really made me question everything I knew.I'm glad I got out of it, but a lot of people don't. A lot of people have eaten this up every day of their lives, they don't know any better and it's really sad how much they cling to it because of it. You give yourself too little credit. You chose to, they could too.Of course there are some geniuses with mental illness, but most of the conspiracy theorists of the Alex Jones ilk have very low IQ.More often than not, people like Alex Jones are at least smart enough to know exactly what they are doing. True idiocy I can sort of forgive... *deliberate* idiocy designed to ensnare idiots for personal gain, on the other hand, I find that despicable. I think with Jones, it's a bit of both: he is very much of the latter, but is also more than a touch insane in his own right.Of course Alex Jones is smart and doesn't believe the conspiracy theories himself.it has nothing to do with IQ but EQ.. those people just fail at logical thinking.Always reminds me of the George Carlin quote - "Picture average intelligence. Now realize that half the population is dumber than that"His best quote was "Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups." That sure came true last year. A mean IQ of 100 means half the population has an IQ below 100. That doesn't even start to recognize that 1 in 6 people have an IQ below 85 (one standard deviation beyond the mean) Yes, there are different ways to measure intelligence; in the context of this conversation, measuring "cognitive ability" is entirely relevant.Yes half the people are below average intelligence, by definition.  But obviously "dumb" or "stupid" is not 99 IQ.   Below 85, you are starting to get pretty dim to be sure.I suppose my point would've been better made had I stuck to the population that falls below one standard deviation to the left of the mean. 1 in 6 people represents 53 million people in the US alone.The problem is no one thinks they are dumb. Everyone says this on Reddit, but no one thinks they are one of the dumb people they are talking about.Seriously, and most of the people who are into that shit are Americans, and in the grand scheme of things we're pretty well educated as a country. Now imagine places like Sub-Saharan Africa where the literacy rate is like 59%. Dumb motherfuckers are probably the majority of the world's population.&gt; who think the earth is flatIt's tough to accept that those people exist in 2017.It's what made me finally give up on my brother. If you can't accept the most fundamental facts about reality, I just can't help.There's more now than ever That's a sadly understated comment; people in Christopher Columbus's time didn't think he'd fall off the edge of the world like a lot of kids (myself included) learned in school. People generally accepted the world was round, they just didn't know that there was a giant continent between Europe and Asia, so they thought Columbus's journey would run out of supplies in the middle of the Ocean.That was in the late 15th century. Hell, even the ancient Greeks knew the Earth was round. Makes you wonder what state of mind people are in if they actually believe the flat Earth crap.Well saidI feel like some Flat-Earthers have to be hardcore trolls who want to cause us suffering by perpetuating the monumental stupidity of that theory.I've always felt that a chunk of the "conspiratards" people talk about are your run of the mill trolls.  Sure there are genuinely crazy people who believe in hardcore conspiracy theories and will advance their beliefs into harassment of victims and others, but I just feel most of the people are people who don't give a shit about the conspiracy, but know that saying and doing outrageous things will generate news articles and discussions like this.  Humanity is a victim of it's own success. With so few natural dangers, virtually no predators, and safeties to prevent accidents, idiots survive and thrive more than ever.It's tough to accept, but it's a fact. I know a fucking *doctor* who believes all of the Alex Jones stuff. He even denies that the earth is round. I'm not talking about a Ph.D doctor. I'm talking about a practicing physician.What baffles me is how otherwise normal they can be. I've had a guy I worked with for three years before I found out he was a Jones nut, and family that believe shit like this. Take these beliefs out of it and they're otherwise normal people. I just don't understand it.In the 60's and 70's he'd be a nutjob with a radio show. In the 80's and 90's he'd be a nutjob with a radio show and a basic website. Yet still he's irrelevant because no one knows who he is. In the 21st century he's a nutjob with a prominent following due to people who constantly post information about him, his website, his following, and his nutjob buddies who believe in it.If the media and the internet never talked about him, no one would know who he is as he's never done anything. Instead we now get articles written about him and a post on the top of r/all every other day complaining about him. I never had a clue who he was until earlier this year, and thanks to reddit and it's fanboys that hang to the left, I know who he is. So I'd like to thank you, and people like you, for constantly posting stories about what Alex Jones and his cronies do. Without you guys caring so much about what they do, I wouldn't have ever known such a shitcan existed.As a famous kid from Colorado once said "at least 1/4 of America is retarded"It's just people who are very very scared by uncertainty and attacks like the Vegas shooting.Like Sandy Hook deniers for example. It's easier for these people to latch on to a conspiracy and defend it than it is to accept that some dorky sack of shit can go buy a rifle at Walmart and just do something so horrible.I never understood the argument for melting steel beams, just heating them up makes them a ton weaker.its steel beamsreeeeeeeeeeeeeI knew a girl who had a cousin that was killed at Sandy Hook. She had moved to Chicago where people obviously weren’t as sensitive to the issue at they are in Connecticut. And let me preface this by saying this girl was rather large and extremely sweet. I’ve never heard her say a negative word about anyone. Anyway, one night we’re at the bar with some friends. Some random drunk guy comes up and annoyingly starts hitting on every girl in our group, pinballing his rejection from one to the next. His form of “hitting on” was just being a complete asshole looking for cheap laughs.So eventually he gets to our big friend and after making a few terrible insults he asks about her accent. She says she’s from Connecticut and before she can finish the sentence he goes “Oh so you know the government set up that bullshit shooting.” I don’t know where his stream of verbal diarrhea was headed from there and never will. This girl wound up her arm like a cartoon character and punched him square to the mouth. The bouncer overheard the situation, kicked him out of the bar, and apologized to our friend. After we consoled her we were able to have a good laugh and then I banged her friend in the ass. Great night all around. &gt; After we consoled her we were able to have a good laugh and then I banged her friend in the ass. Great night all around.holy shit spoiler alertAs a Chicagoan, this is pretty surprising to hear.  But as an Illinoisan, it sadly is not.  Sorry that the world's full of dipshits brainwashed by sick entertainment.Y'all motherfuckers can't just add -an to the end of any convenable location and expect it to work.- TexanChicagoan has been used since the late 1800s. and then everyone clappedonly that ass, apparentlyAnd then he found a $100 bill in it!Lmao goddamn brogreat story, made me feel good, smile, *and* made me feel good for you! fuck that ass brahI found out about a year ago my own brother was a Sandy Hook denier.We had followed Alex Jones when we were teens. We soaked up everything he put out about 9/11. When I became an adult I came to my senses and realized the bullshit I used to listen to. I wasn't sure where he stood, but I didn't care. Until about a year ago I found out he still followed some theories. Which I thought was harmless, until I found out one of them was the vaccine/autism. Good thing his son's mother has a more sensible brain, and my nephew gets all of his shots. Of course, when Vegas happened I was especially upset because that's our home town. Yet him, and a lot of my Vegas friends started sharing the 'Second Shooter' posts. There was a clearly two different types of people on my feed. The ones donating blood, and donating goods and the ones sharing conspiracy theories.  Fellow Vegas resident here, my aunt (who doesn't live here) went online and started posting all the conspiracy theory bullshit she could find. We got into a big fight on FB and she ended up blocking me.  I have tolerated her idiotic nonsense for years, and finally started mocking her for it.   Next family event is going to be gloriously awkwardSo what's the conspiracy?Like, what was she even trying to prove?&gt; So what's the conspiracy?&gt; Like, what was she even trying to prove?People find it hard to believe that in a situation like the Las Vegas shootings, there is a lot of confusion and reports of multiple suspects. Just like every other shooting and terrorism act.Honestly I couldn't even figure it out.   Just that there certainly was a second shooter, in her mind.    And that the media was behind it.  I think I lost a few brain cells just thinking about your comment there, I shouldn't have asked."the media" jesus christ The conspiracy is multiple, but as in all, the summary is; what we're being told isn't true. Here are the multiple conspiracies, is my best non biased way. I support none. Multiple shooters, police in their radio scans on multiple incidents reported multiple shooters, as did people in the crowd. People have intepreted the audio from the videos as being consistent with multiple guns. Some videos have been analyzed as seeing muzzle flair on the 4th floor from behind the hotel. Paddock was CIA and this was a gun dealing operation gone wrong. The idea is that there was a gun selling operation that went wrong and the people buying the guns decided to rampage and then leave. Paddock was set up by the government to commit a false  flag terror attack to justify more systems, specifically from OSI systems who some claim to benefit from the attack. False Flags generally help investors who have hedged their bets correctly (if you belive in all this) All if it was faked. Some say it was purely speakers playing the gunshot noises and actors were used on the scene. Same motivations as previously. To my knowledge, this is the breadth of conspiracies surrounding vegas. Personally, I think details are difficult to come by just because the Casinos are tough to work with, lots of data to go through but ultimately a crazy, sick, lone man. The most impressive/confusing thing to me is the combination of "The government is evil" and "Trump is our savior".Apparently none of them associate Trump with the government.Think about it, who has the most to benefit from a conspiracy? Who stands to gain the most and lose the least? Who is the one person who never seems to have an alibi and is the first to point fingers?Two people seen escaping from Sandy Hook - did anyone see Alex Jones that day? Two shooters suspected in Vegas - where was Alex Jones? While everyone was looking at Pizza Planet's pedophilia ring, was anyone looking at Alex Jones's hard drive? Can Alex Jones actually prove he *didn't* plant thermite in  the World Trade Center?They are not "theorists." They have no theory. Call them what they are: delusionists.They also don't have a "maybe I'm wrong" possibility in their minds.  Not even a little tiny one, like assigning a 1% likelihood to the possibility... they are unwaiveringly locked into their perception.  Otherwise they wouldn't treat imagined offenders the way they do.I forget but there's a term for reverse-engineering actual events to make them fit into a conspiracy theory. What's it called?making shit upThese guys are as bad as the Sandy Hook truthers. Pretty sure they're one and the same.That’s because they’re the same people. I feel like i say this everyday, but What the fuck is wrong with people?Abhorrent as it is, it's also not at all surprising.  Every time something like this happens, there's always someone online who thinks it's a massive conspiracy to TAKE AWAY YER GUNZ.  It's odd.  If the 'shadow government' was powerful and influential enough to stage a shooting like this, you'd think they'd be a bit more successful at enacting gun control.  Correction: when the shooter is a white American, it's a "false flag." When the shooter is a nonwhite American or an immigrant, it's totally true. These are almost exclusively white male neckbeards who refuse to believe one of their own can be a mass murderer.  Facebook, where intelligent discourse goes to die.Why won't facebook ban people who make threats like this? It's easy enough for them to track down users who post these kinds of comments.People think this was a hoax? How do they explain the reams of video shot while the shooting was in place? How did they get thousands of people to cooperate, including being visibly wounded, without any of them going public with their tale? It really beggars the imagination. Government plan to enforce gun control, crisis actors, Alex Jones.The party of government that heavily relies on the single issue voters of the second amendment control every aspect of the US government set up a false flag attack to try and pass gun control laws?Makes sense. Well, of course the answer to that would be its the "Obama deep state actors" still in the US Government that carried it out. But yeah, right?That's so ridiculous.  Why would conspiracy theorists come up with such a contrived theory? I feel like it would be much easier and more straightforward to theorize that the government had an agent do the shooting for real, or even manipulated a mentally unstable person into actually doing it.There are still people that legitimately think the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism and that children are being sold as sex slaves out of a pizza parlor.Never underestimate how stupid people can be.Obviously, the lizard deep state set up crisis actors to film! These are the people who set up Kennedy and the moon landing!! With a little CGI and makeup they could fill an empty area with as many people as they wanted!!!Please buy my tactical taint wipes. Only 99.95 each to protect your taint from ISIS Commie germs. I don't get paid to do this!/s just in caseHow pathetic does your life have to be to get this low? I mean, seriously?Conspiracy theorists are truly some of the most mentally ill people you'll ever meet. They think everything truthful is a lie, and everything that is a lie (which is pretty much anything out of Alex Jones's mouth) is the truth. They're literally flip flopped on reality. EDIT: To clarify, yes, some conspiracy theories are true, but the second someone starts spouting nonsense about "crisis victims" or thinking a pizza place houses Hillary Clintons child sex slaves without any evidence of that claim, or thinking everything is a conspiracy you lose all credibility.Conspiracy theories used to be fun like, "What happened in Roswell?," "Is Big Foot Real?," or "Did someone else shoot JFK?"  Now they're all shit like, "Are all Democrats secretly pedophiles?," "Is every instance of gun violence committed by white people actually just Democrats trying to make guns look bad so they can take them away?," or "Is government oversight in any way shape or form actually Democrats trying to control our minds and take away all of our rights?"Don’t forget about the lizard people running the world’s governments. I can’t help but laugh whenever I hear that, but their are people who believe that it’s real. Yeah, lizard people is silly; rich people aren't cold-blooded monsters who see no value in the humanity of the masses...shit.Lmao, imagine if thats how it started- calling them "lizard people" and then someone thought they meant actual liazard people.It's actually a way to blame the Jews without saying "Jew"While there are a lot of conspiracy theories that find ways to (((do that))) I've never understood--do they think all the people they accuse of being lizards (The British royal family, the Clintons, the Bushes, etc.) are all jews as well as lizards?Except not all Jews are rich and not all rich are Jews, but I don't doubt you're right about the idiots saying this.It would explain global warming. Lizards are cold blooded, right? They're just trying to geo-engineer Earth to be like their planet. Our extinction is just a fringe benefit. And of course making us believe the world is round is all part of the plan. If people knew it were flat they'd just run and flip to the other side and escape the warming because it's cooler on the side away from the sun.They killed JFK you lizard denialists will know the truth soon![David Icke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke)The lizard people aren't real??Vaccines + LGBT agenda = globalist plan for Islam to take over the world.Yes, I've seen this one."is a military drill a secret democrat plan to overthrow Texas (lolwat?!) and put everybody in FEMA run concentration camps inside of retro-fitted walmarts for [reasons]?"There have always been unbelievably shitty conspiracy theories, they just don't usually stand that test of time. Like, conservatives don't talk about Kennedy's "secret divorce" any more, but they [sure used to](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b19eb1b424a039546780f8a553bf12f4.webp).And remember the Maine!? People were *convinced* its sinking was a false flag attack. People were convinced of Papist plots to overthrow America, and the Freemasons were blamed for everything that happened for hundreds of years.Wasn't the Maine basically an accident used as an excuse to start a war? Seems pretty close to a false flag to me. They didn’t know at the time it was an accident. Saying it was a false flag is implying the US blew it up on purpose. It's not really "conspiracy theorists" anymore so much as it is "Republicans."There's been a major radicalization of the right wing in the last decadesSome kids in Macedonia make a killing with fake click bait news websites. Read somewhere they used to target football fans on transfer days (messi to x club kinda thing) and fake health sites but then found that right wing were a gold mine. Pretty much another reason why election had so much bullshit news. It weirds me out how fake news is largely not done for partisan or political reasons, it's literally just to make money off stupid people.The far-right has a seemingly limitless demand for conspiracy theories and Chinese-made political gag gifts.I swear to god I've got a relative who went without indoor plumbing for like 9 months because he's so broke, but he spent probably $300 on either pro-Trump or anti-Hillary gag merchandise like Hillary Clinton toilet paper or Make America Great Again welcome mats.  These people are some of America's biggest suckers.Listen to the ads that run on your local right wing talk stations. It's all snake oil bullshit that only really gullible people would buy : collectors coins, apocalypse preparedness kits, fluoride flirtation systems, fluoride resist pills, insane mortgages that are absolutely predatory, money lending that's even more predatory, and all sorts of anti liberal scare tactic products. Ugh, the apocalypse nuts piss me off the most. I was a Girl Scout for 13 years and I live next to the San Andreas fault line. Be prepared is my motto, but now it's got a weird stigma to it. I'm not a conspiracy nut, I just like having supplies because that's what a smart person should do living in my region.Right, but does your prep kit have radiation proof gas masks for when the US gets nuked? Or maybe spray on anti radiation sun screen? Nope, but buying normal stuff is more annoying now that these nuts are more common.Literally the reason I left the party 10 years ago.  I just couldn't keep up with the requisite number of "conspiracy theories" needed to make it sound reasonable.That's the thing that gets me... like... fine, you think takes are bad and that government is ineffective if not harmful. Like, fine. I don't agree, but okay, Ron Swanson, we can be buddies that civilly disagree.Why does that require buddying up with folks that think Obama is a secret Muslim whose wife is secretly trans, and are both part of a secret pedophile ring that... also wants to take over the world or something?It was a long time coming.  It starts with Pat Robertson in the 80s.  The 700 Club were the original Fox News and almost single-handedly converted the Southern Baptists (19th Century Confederate/Democrats as religion) over to Evangelicalism (Modern Republicans as religion).  At that time, there were a lot of people desperate to believe that science was part of a vast global anti-Christian conspiracy against them.  It didn't really matter to Republican donors if people believed the Earth was a newborn planet or if humans were magic mammals, but they *did* have a vested interest in denying the environmental sciences, so a perverse syncretism was born.  The result is that half of the Baby Boomer generation have been promised that humanity will be destroyed within their lifetime, and they *really* don't want to miss the show.  But Obama wasn't the antichrist they were hoping for, so apparently they went and found their own.God... The 700 Club.  What a bunch of shitheads.  If there is a hell, they deserve it.But they are turning the freaking frogs gay.I'm more concerned about the vampire goblins, tbh.https://youtu.be/uWd6XgBVIcgNobody thinks of the Lizard People. Smh&gt; everything that is a lie (which is pretty much anything out of Alex Jones's mouth) is the truth.And we have a President who openly embraces and believes the words Alex Jones is preaching.  Its not just conspiracy theorists, its spilling into the Republican party as a whole.The difference is evidence. You can tell a good conspiracy theory because there are witnesses or some sort of anecdotal account, or in some cases a blatant cover-up. There's usually some tantalizing bit of information that makes you suspicious.What Infowars does (it's right there in the name) is a combination of a lot of factors, the big one being what I call "left turn into crazy town" arguments. It's a kind of social hacking.You start with a true fact. You make a logical argument from that (keeping in mind that untruth can be logical,) and then you make a sudden, insane argument based upon that. That's a sharp left turn into crazy town. The reader follows your train of thought right up until it goes nuts. Because they've internalized your more reasonable arguments, and your previous logical untruth left no other conclusion, confirmation bias takes over.Combine this with other social pressures and it becomes a powerful devil's brew of hysteria. Misogyny, fear, racism, mental illness, confusion and loneliness all make someone a good  target.I've spent a lot of time in the culture of conspiracy, on reddit and otherwise. I used to be a believer. I am not any longer. Sure I have some "woke" awareness about some things and a theory or two, but I don't cling to them as an ideology. I used to.Years ago I was a pretty awful alcoholic. 18-30 beers a day, easy. I was depressed. Very depressed. I was lonely. Fast forward a bit. Met someone who loved me at my lowest, who brought me back up to light. Quit drinking, started a career, and the conspiracy thing just sort of went by the wayside.I realized that it was a crutch to that depression. That's why I believed it. I was depressed, the world was at fault, *not me*. *My* actions couldn't *possibly* be the root cause of my depression, no, it's *them*. "My alcoholism had nothing to do with it!"After about 3 months sober I had a "moment of clarity" and saw all this. Conspiracy theorists, those who are in the communities and such, are mostly wildly depressed. I don't think "mentally ill" is the best general descriptor, though depression is an illness. But they are seeking answers like an addict seeks answers at the bottom of a bottle. For that reason I made it my goal to *not* just write them off, to not just hate them, or call them stupid, but to try to meet them where they are and speak to them from a place of clear-headed rationality. I spent many many months on /r/conspiracy doing this before my alt was banned for "my general tone". Happened after I started talking about vaccines and how they *don't* cause autism. But in that time there were over a dozen users who had PMed me to thank me for being a calm voice among the rest. There are a lot of people afraid and living in fear and paranoia and depression, and those all go hand in hand. I think we should really try not to demonize them and remember they're just humans, and any one of us, given the right circumstance, could be just like them. I think the idea that things happen at random are very disturbing to conspiracy folks, so they make up "reasons".  Makes the world more understandable and less frightening. I would be more inclined to believe that if it didn't so often turn into "the Jews!" at the end of that. I think maybe they're just bad people sometimes. Thanks for that. Your post is very reasonable and a hell of a lot more moderate than those calling conspiracy nuts evil. Evil implies they're supporting it while knowing it's wrong. I don't see that. It looks more like mental illness or cognitive bias.&gt; Conspiracy theorists, those who are in the communities and such, are mostly wildly depressed.Yeah I can agree with this assessment. The inclination towards believing wild conspiracy theories could definitely be born of a sense of depression and an attempt to combat that by trying to be part of something bigger like uncovering crazy, global conspiracies.&gt; I think we should really try not to demonize them I'm down to try not to. But if they call some poor bastard that's recovering from a 5.56 to the leg, my patience is gonna wear thin real quicky.This really puts things into perspective. Thank you. It makes sense that one would seek out a group of likeminded individuals when they've reached rock bottom subsistence. Now they all share their misery and dive deeper into their delusions together. How the hell do we help them? &gt; How the hell do we help them?It's not easy. What I do is just keep it in mind and instead of writing them off, dismissing them, calling them names, I try to explain the logic of whatever event they're looking at. Debunk it without malice, but to encourage understanding. And, ya know, just ask personal questions in small talk. "How's life?". People don't treat each other like other people far too often.And also, realize that not all of them care to be helped or think they need it. You won't see me debating flat earthers. Some people are just trolls, others are just stubborn, but I try to recognize those from others who are just sitting in their homes afraid. That's another thing: I'm always against fear mongering. It's not useful, it's harmful. It literally drives people insane. So I try to squash that shit when I see it.I've noticed a pattern. Conspiracy theorists are *almost always* lonely and unemployed people with way too much time on their hands. I spend that time watching YouTube videos from random ass people about conspiracy theories and browsing conspiracy sites.Fool a conspiracy theorist.Tell them that Alex Jones is government agent sent out to spread misinformation and distract the public from the real issues.It works every-time.Edit to that:  Conspiracy theorists who are ignorant and believe some internet talk show host over basic video or other proof in front of them are evil. There are some conspiracy theories that have some teeth, and you can tell they're legitimate because they aren't on /r/conspiracy and they aren't the same people every time. Like when a NASA spokesman mentioned space colonization being hampered by the Van Allen belt. A lot of conspiracy theorists jumped on this as proof that the moon landing was faked. Amateur boy detectives everywhere.  And they all refuse to look up the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)."The fewer dots you have to work with, the easier it is to *connect* them!"  :DWell yeah, a straight line connects two points, right? CHECKMATE VEGAS BELIEVERS!That's a bit of a blanket statement, don't you think? Or do you really mean literally every person who believes in the possibility of a conspiracy is mentally ill?The comments on all the stupid false flag videos on YouTube will make you sick.  It's absolutely mind boggling how moronic some people are.I love how highly they think of themselves.  The other day there was a post on /r/conspiracy comparing themselves to the journalist that was recently killed. They think they're like someone who actually uses evidence and facts.  This was a little before there was another high post of what could of been a person on top of a roof during the Las Vegas shooting saying "SECOND SHOOTER CONFIRMED".  Nothing was confirmed.  You add in harrassing victims, flat earth, and all the other bullshit they spout.  /r/conspiracy used to be a fun subreddit to browse, but now it's just sad. It got really awful after the election.I saw one a few days ago by someone saying the fires in Oregon were caused by the three Sisters erupting. He amount of likes, views, and comments that agreed made me lose hope in humanity. Got to believe most of them are very religious as well.  Dumb people are almost always religious.I thought the pizza thing was 4Chan trolling.  It may have started that way but some stay at home Mom (I shit you not) and her husband/boyfriend/whatever he was who thought they were a legitimate news agency started running with the story which led the dude to show up at the pizza shop with a gun trying to find the "kidnapped kids". Betcha a dollar, Infowars is well represented in these people's browser history.  Jones owns this nightmare that he's created with all of his false flag BS.  I'm not saying I want any violence to befall him, but if it does, I want to be at the front of the line to call it a false flag and call him a *crisis actor*.  Fuck himHe pretty much is a crisis actor already...Yet more proof why to not have a Facebook account or if you do why to not use your really name or location. Sad no lifers feed off of what people post on social media and use it to harass people they don't have the balls to in real life.Jesus Christ, if they think that there were fake victims they should just go to r/watchpeopledie and see it for themselves. These people are disgusting. We specifically filter out the words 'Crisis Actors' for this very reason. That one video of the aftermath is haunting.Yeah, the video of the guy doing SMART triage was a hard one for me to get through. He did an amazing job considering the circumstances. That's the problem with the Sandy Hook false flag narrative. If you can get people believing that shit about dead kids then the Genie is well out of the bottle.Yo guys, theres a difference between entertaining conspiracy theories, actively investigating conspiracy theories, and what this guy is doing......which is just being a complete asshole who happens to subscribe to this conspiracy theory. Thinking H.W may have been involved in the Franklin cover up doesn't automatically mean that you need to call victims and harass them. Theres good people, and assholes. This guy is just a straight up asshole. Internet Tough Guys at it again... *Sigh*Don't knock Super Male Vitality until you've tried it, bro. I'd say there are at least 2 types of conspiracy theorists.  There are the insane, knuckle draggers, they're not thinking on their own, they just soak up whatever they're told basically, which is insane to me. They just repeat everything they hear from someone like Alex Jones, without questioning what he is saying. These are the types that feel the need to insult everyone who doesn't think the exact same as them. Then there are people who just like to approach everything with some questions, and you'll see certain aspects if a story and question the why and the how. You don't need to greedily lap up everything that whichever side is trying yo feed you, you can try and ask questions and look into it yourself. But ultimately it does nothing except drive you crazy, because say you ask a question that can't be answered by the official narrative, then you question what really happened, you can't do anything about it, and you know nobody believes you anyways. So it kind of sucks.   I find there to be a ton of unusual things occurring in the Vegas shooting. Lots of stuff that doesn't add up, and i would love to know why. But I don't think that it didn't occur, nor am I going to shoot up a place Alex Jones says is behind it or something...People more knowledgeable than me: is there any legal recourse that these victims have? There are 340,000,000 people in America.The overwhelming vast majority are decent hardworking people. If just 1% of the people were crazy that still leaves 3,400,000. But it is way less than that. Lets say 0.01 are certifiably crazy dangerous people that means 34,000 are walking around everyday among us.That is the simple truth to a lot of these incidents. You wonder how Trump got elected. Well all these conspiracy nut cases voted for him to protect their gun rights. Same people claimed Sandy Hook was a conspiracy. My heart goes out to the victims of Vegas and their families. And Trump publicly supporting a man who thought Sandy Hook has faked.How much of the voting block do conspiracy theories make up? I wonder, too. My brother is so far in the rabbit hole he won't even register to vote because "that's how they track ya."We should work on spreading that one.Finally, a conspiracy theory I can get behind!probably a lot of crossover with the "obama is a kenyan muslim" crowd and that's like half of registered republicans.Kenyan Muslim?  That's absurd.  Everyone "knows" he's an "Indonesian Communist."Why can't he be both! I mean Kenya and Indonesia are all part of the same country of Notamerica.Ha! My dad believes both. Probably about half the country, if you aggregate through entire range of conspiracy nuts. Shit, our President believed the Obama birth certificate conspiracy and the antivaxx conspiracy.  Polling shows that enormous numbers of Americans believe in all sorts of insane shit.In terms of the Vegas conspiracies specifically, the numbers are probably much, much lower.One example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polls_about_9/11_conspiracy_theoriesHuh, I'm surprised you can have a slash like that in a URL.I think you may be overestimating the amount of people who believe this by a few orders of magnitude.Trump embraced that crowd. And that crowd has been bolstered by a decade or two of right wing media lunacy which just blatantly makes up the most ridiculous shit. But to say these guys got him elected might be overstating it a bit./r/conspiracy and those tiny subs that grew like tumors when the shooting happened are some of the worst subs to exist. It’s really quite odd how they use anything to say the shooting was staged in some way.Conspiracy people are fun to fuck with.   I usually play ignorant and ask questions at first,  then come back at them with a "oh, that's just what they *want* you to believe" and then drop an even crazier theory but with a dead serious delivery.  For example when people bring up the Illuminati/Bilderbergs/Rothschilds I'm like "Oh yeah, they totally *were* running things until the internet became self aware and secretly took over, those people are just sock puppets.". Haha, good times.Ditto. Leave them alone.The vindictive part of me hopes such idiots get shot in a senseless mass shooting--and then have strangers harrass and threaten them while dealing with the aftereffects, pain, and trauma of being a random victim of violence.Disgusting and horrible for the survivors to bear this rubbish being spewed by morons. Have some decency and empathy for the survivors of a gun attack please.the people harassing the victims are the lowest common denominator of human decencyNow that's a patriot. His govt called on him and he let them shoot him in the head. That's true dedication to a cause.I'm trying to imagine how that conversation would go....... (mysterious music rises as the scene shifts to a fog shrouded bridge....)...Govt. official: We're creating a conspiracy, we need to your help because you're the best at what you do.Candidate:You know I'll do whatever it takes. What do I have to do?Govt. official: Stand still while we have someone shoot you in the head.Candidate: F**k that noise!! Hey! Get your hands off me....  NNOOooooo.....Govt. official: (speaking to mystery leader of shadow organization that doesn't officially exist) He's in. Now we just need five or six hundred more "volunteers" and we're golden....This is what I find so hard to understand. For all the lying Bush and Cheney did about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, it would have been SO easy to go plant something in the middle of the Iraqi government to say look see, we told you! But no, we're expected to believe the government brought down the WTC, killed little kids in Connecticut and conducted the largest mass shooting in the United States...and not ONE person has blabbed about it?
So, she *does* want the linemen to go home?Yep, she's shooting to be governor of PR and is anti-statehood so she's doing anything she can to make it look like the US government failed to boost her future campaign.So what does her party want, independence? I mean I assume that it's all a ploy and that she wants Puerto Rico to remain a territory, but how does a reaction of "Look, the US' aid isn't quick enough for my dilapidated, woefully under-maintained island. We would be so better alone!" work? I'd say it's more likely she's just trying to put herself as local opposition to Mean Mr. Trump, and hoping that will carry her. That's definitely an element of it, she's not a Trump fan either. But she does want PR to be an independent country and she's banking on making the US look bad to boost this idea. "See the US failed us in our time of need but if we were our own nation with me in charge we'd make Puerto Rico great again!" She's not PIP, she's PDP. PDP is the status quo / commonwealth party. For those people asking why Puerto Rico didn't get the same response as the mainland hurricanes, it's because they didn't use the existing sharing agreements between utilities, probably because they didn't meet the requirements to use those.Here's how it usually works: http://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/electricreliability/mutualassistance/Documents/MA_101FINAL.pdfHere's a NPR article that talks about that exact issue. The PR utility company opted not to use it and had basically contracted Whitefish before Maria hit in preparation for widespread damage. http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/24/559864118/tiny-montana-firm-gets-300-million-contract-to-help-restore-power-in-puerto-ricoThey opted not to use the sharing agreement because they would have to pony up resources to do so.With this Whitefish contract, they didn't pay anything up front, and it will be up to Whitefish to collect from a bankrupt utility.  *That's* why almost nobody else bid on this, and Whitefish won.Well in that case they are putting a lot of faith in PR and PREPA. Any idea what actions would be available to Whitefish to recoup the payment if PR doesn't pay?They'd have to sue to get paid, and stand in line with the other places Puerto Rico owes money to.That was one of the main reasons the Whitefish Energy was favorable to PREPA and the Governor of PR. Almost all the other companies wanted $25 million up front, because of PR's terrible financial situations. NYT's stated that Whitefish Energy received $3 million up front to start hiring subcontractors. Yeah I believe that's touched on in the article to. I can't remember if I read this in an article or a redditors comment, but I was under the impression that FEMA ponied up that $3 million. That is in no way a fact because I don't have a source on hand.Edit: Here is a quote from the NPR article I posted earlier, "At least at the outset, Whitefish's bills will likely be paid with money from FEMA, which on Monday announced more than $215 million in assistance to PREPA. Whitefish could be paid up to $300 million for the work."Yeah the $300 million is pretty much all money from FEMA given towards PR for disaster relief. The issue is that it's going to the PR government to manage, which hasn't exactly been their strength in recent years. Whitefish isn’t doing the work, they are subing it out. If PR stiffs them they just don’t pay the people that do the work. Not true I have seen White Fish utility trucks on the highway and can tell you they have union bug stickers on the back.I could be mistaken. I had read that it only consisted of 2 employees and the entire PR job was to be done by “ short contract” staff.But muh narrative! Muh corruption!I was told it was corruptionProbably by someone who wanted you think there was corruption.&gt; That's why almost nobody else bid on this, and Whitefish won.there was no bid.  The Whitefish guy himself will tell you that.  "nobody else bid on this"Because it didn't go through the normal, or any reasonable, bidding process.And yes, they will get paid. I suggest you take a month to understand PROMESA.One other company bid on it, but they wanted a 25 million dollar down payment.This should be covered by federal disaster relief aide. My tax dollers should pay for this. If a disaster happened in Ohio I'd be expecting the same aide under federal disaster relief. Hell when tornadoes rip down three counties power lines and we're out of power I'm pretty damn sure it does come from a disaster relief fund, I don't recall if it's state or federal though."in Ohio"But Puerto Rico isn't a state.but it's in a state, in a state of *no electricity.* trol lol lol :-)Red pills all around bartender.Typical Puerto Rican swindling.Oh hey actual information, I wandered into /r/politics earlier and expected the worst... and received it of course.  What a sub full of dullardsOne of the threads someone talked about Trump being responsible for a genocide, because he's a Nazi.you mean like every post submitted there?Basically. If someone isn't calling Trump a literal Nazi who wants to gas Muslims, they'll be downvoted. It's such a silly subreddit. Go from sucking off Bernie, and calling him the messiah, with Hillary being Satan. To suddenly "TRUMP IS HITLER! HE'S GONNA GAS PEOPLE!" The best way to argue against circlejerks apparently is to participate in circlejerks.Oh come now.  You're saying you don't have to be the sharpest tool in the shed to echo something you heard on a blog or other partisan news source?I mean I can admit I'm an idiot 99% of the day, but I'm aware of it.  The confidence of the comments on that sub are hillarious though.RMAGs aren't going to help Puerto Rico. It's separated from the US mainland by about a thousand miles. How many utility companies have transatlantic capabilities?RMAGs work great on the mainland, but they aren't going to help our colonial territories. Those territories shouldn't be looking for help to come from thousands of miles away -- they should be developing their own regional associations with other Caribbean countries.Unfortunately, because Puerto Rico is neither a state nor a country, it can't conduct foreign diplomacy nor can it influence American diplomacy.Then that's what's appears broken imo. Why is it that in the face of a disaster with fellow American citizens lives destroyed we have to rely on such a shitty system of agreements in order to start the work of repair? Where's the simple goodwil? Why the hell isn't there something in place for disaster relief invokable under local executive power (mayoral/governor) that can get the boots moving on repairs right away knowing they'll be paid by federal disaster relief funds that can be third party negotiated after the fact? I'm honorably discharged from my time served in the Navy, I claim 0 dependents on my taxes yearly, I'm a millennial with a good paying job relative to my college degree (thanks to the G.I. Bill). If I could decide where my taxes were going I'd be happy to see my taxes go to restoring power under such simple federal aide as opposed to what blatently looks like shady deals from a company with shady ties.The only reason this is an issue is because Puerto Rico is bankrupt.You are assuming Whitefish are the bad guys here, when Puerto Rico knows they are going to stiff them on payment anyway.  *Everybody* knows that, except the clueless people here on reddit.  If it's so common knowledge and a for-sure​ thing Whitefish is going to get stiffed, why are they doing it then? Out of the goodness of their hearts? Enlighten me, o' Reddit economist, because from where I'm sitting that obviously doesn't add up.They'll take 50 cents on the dollar.  It's still a lot of money to them.&gt; Where's the simple goodwil?$300 million worth of goodwill?  You first, chief!What office is this lady preparing to run for? Governor of PR.makes sense now.She's also staunchly opposed to statehood in direct conflict with the governors position of pro-statehood which gives you an idea of why she would want to paint this entire thing as a failure of the US government and the PR governor. she's not very subtle is she? Thanks for sharing!Well i'd say she is extremely subtle seeing as how the media and most American's believe we are failing Puerto Rico.  I haven't taken side because I know I have no idea how recovery efforts work but I have definitely noticed she is being aggressive on her stance and thought she had an agenda.That's because our nation DID fail Puerto Rico. Doctors are having to do surgery by cellphone light on that island for crying out loud.I want to know how they had functional cellphones yet apparently no flashlights. How did we fail PR? By not inventing magic?Which begs the question, why did the govt of PR not send those patients to the USS Comfort, just offshore and waiting for PR to send them people to help?yeah but the left hates trump so much they are willing to turn a blind eye to this political manipulation because it could make trump look badIt's only because of Federal funds and the US government Puerto Rico is as successful as it is. The local Puerto Rican government consistently gets ranked near the bottom in terms of good governance. They also rank high in Corruption.Case in point many believe Greece to be better run government. The only reason Puerto Rico isn't in worst shape is because the US government.The Island of Puerto Rico has not had a balanced budget for over 50 years. In the last 15 years PR nearly doubled their debt, it didn't go up more because they have had problems finding people to loan them money.https://tradingeconomics.com/puerto-rico/ratingThey have one of the worst credit ratings in the world. Declaring Bankruptcy might help, but they have already settled and are going through a process similar to Bankruptcy. It hasn't done anything to improve the rating.The Independent Puerto Rican group, and those who lean that way like the mayor, don't really understand non political environments. I hope she doesn't win. It is obvious she puts politics above people. From failing to distribute supplies and not attending FEMA meetings and now this. If she had her way Puerto Ricans would be without power for months as she would try to find a better contract.Good luck, the reason PR picked this company is because many others refused to work with them and wanted more money upfront. That is what happens when you're broke with no credit worthiness and in an environment where any mistakes will be blamed on you. I wonder if she has a governorship campaign t-shirt made for this talking point too.  Is this the same mayor that said she wanted free of US financial independence, and then complained that the US wasn't giving her enough money?That's the one. People seem to be oblivious that she's a hardline pro-independence politician who has eyes on the governorship. The Independence movement in PR isn't very popular. She has exploited every move anyone has made to try to demonize the US response and praise the international efforts, just to make people think it was a failure, to drive support towards her position. Notice that she's had nothing but praise for NGOs from other countries (like the food Goya (Mexican) donated) but has literally complained about everything the US has done, usually without any actual proof. Like when she made the absurd claim that FEMA had only given them four pallets of water. Nobody could actually confirm this. No paperwork proof was provided, no accounting records, nothing. She just claimed that FEMA only gave them four pallets of water and in the same breath said that Mexico had given them 200,000 pounds of food.I mean the best was that she was on Twitter whining about sexism and bitching out the power repair company contract, and then said 'Shouldn't you be fixing the power instead of complaining on Twitter'? The irony was apparently lost on her and all of her idiot supporters.I saw that Twitter fight as well. It made me wonder if only the little people were without power.&gt; It made me wonder if only the little people were without power.Pretty much.  Most of San Juan's power has already been restored. I live in San Juan and i barely know people with power...Yeah no power here. Un poste está roto so hay que esperar. Ya yo tengo luz en los paseos pero solo conozco a como 5 de mi colegio que le llego la luz. "Definitely no power here in San Juan, ignore me posting on Reddit on the Internet which requires a great many electric devices throughout the city and my home to be on" -_-Thats not what I heard from my friends family She sounds like a peace of shit.The contract is corruption. It’s a 300 million dollar contract given to a company with two employees. One of whom is a major trump supporter. She wants the power fixed and the taxpayer dollars to go to fixing the grid, not paying some dude’s yacht and blow.It’s corruption because one of the owners is pro Trump? Fuck out of here with that logic.They’re a contracting company and like every other one they sub the work out to the hundreds or thousands that are needed.Not to mention the group that sold the contract was PRs own utility organization. Whitefish was easy because they offered to do it for less with minimal of the payment upfront.You are the only person with actual evidence of corruption, please show it.My favorite part is how you went quiet.https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2017/10/24/1709359/-Congress-looking-into-how-two-man-firm-got-the-contract-to-rebuild-Puerto-Rico-s-electrical-gridSounds like someone Russia would sponsor&gt;She has exploited every move anyone has made to try to demonize the US response and praise the international efforts, just to make people think it was a failure, to drive support towards her position.If you've noticed a trend with almost every anti-Trump or anti-US response post on Reddit regarding Puerto Rico they always involve Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz.Basically yes.  She’s fed off of the international attention due to hating trump.  Now she gets exposed for not giving a shit about the city shes supposedly representing.She's garbage, but that doesn't change the fact that these US citizens need US-obligated assistance.Sure but they're getting that assistance. Oh oh. Is this the same mayor who printed the shirt before handing out FEMA aids? The same one who throw the aids in the dumpster? What do you expect the Puerto Ricans to do, other than complain? It's not like they can vote for more money, or vote for a different President.They have no representation in government. What else can they do?If the contract is cancelled, then how she gonna get power restored? Wasn't she bitching about having no power a few days ago? She is just the worst, I'm glad she's not my mayor. Look at [these satellite images.](http://time.com/4957119/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-power-outage-photos/)  Most of San Juan has their power restored already.  Canceling the contract and extending the time it takes for the rest of the country to get power would directly benefit her campaign for governor and help support her anti-statehood position which is in direct conflict with the incumbent. That’s definitely not most, maybe 1/4 if you wanted to compare it by how bright it looks like from space. But power=/=luminescence sometimes. And well this article is from the 26th of September, so it’s not a good article to use currently.Mayor Crocodile Tears can't get herself on the teevee enough. She has a governorship to win. I think the Democrats have found their Sarah Palin. She's anti-Statehood, which is the whole reason she hates Trump. If the linesmen left she can say "See! The USA is incompetent, we should become independent!" Do people actually still listen to this stupid woman?Unfortunately yes.  Every single time any decision is made about Puerto Rico, the very first phone call these media outlets make is to her rather than the governor because they know she will put forward the view they want on air.   Go to /r/politics, they're basically worshipping her. It doesn't matter.  Most people are one trial learners and so the first story about her is how most people will view it.Of course she is, and then when her island continues to go for several more months without a stable electrical grid, she will bitch and moan some more about how Trump doesn't care about Puerto Rico.This woman is a menace and at this point is jeopardizing her own people for talking points. This lady is so full of shit it is actually absurd she was able to get elected in the first place.Why are we listing to a mayor and not a governor? The narrative pushing in r/news is insane. because she repeatedly trashes Trump, and is therefore the only sane voice in PR /sr/news is not so bad... stroll on over to r/politics if you want to see insane...[deleted]    printf("Sorry human.");The company got the award because they agreed to start the work without being paid up front.This is an advantage to Puerto Rico, whether you understand it or not.And yet another example of the genius minds in PR, who are willing to sacrifice their citizens for a few political points.San Juan mayor is a jerk.But some of us were saying this for some time.I'm pretty sure she doesn't want any of this resolved. It's political gold for her.It must be frustrating being Puerto Rican and seeing your leader collapse into tears every time she does an interview.The governor of PR praised the U.S.'s efforts, and even Trump.I really cannot stand seeing that every time she's on the news Don't they just default on all their debt anyway?Federal disaster aide I'd expect would cover this. I'm honorably discharged from my time served in the Navy, I claim 0 dependents on my taxes yearly, I'm a millennial with a good paying job relative to my college degree (thanks to the G.I. Bill). If I could decide where my taxes were going I'd want it to be going to restore PR and the livelihood of my fellow American citizens.I agree with the sentiment but wish PR paid their fair share of income taxes, too (in exchange for full statehood). I think the statehood or independence vote should be forced. No territory should exist with such a large population. They end up being both second class citizens and unduly high recipients of federal aid. &gt; time served in the NavyYou don't need to tell everyone that you are gay.  PR will have it's electricity restored, and don't worry your tax dollars will pay for it.  I just hope it is done better this time than when PR was handling it themselves.  I've heard numerous reports on NPR that the company in question may have got the contract in a suspicious way, but is doing a fine job of repairing the power grid.  I know, I know, anything even distantly affiliated with Trump must be awful, but it does seem like these guys are doing an ok job.  Maybe we should be happy for a tiny 2 man company that got the 600 million dollar contract of a lifetime.But they didn't.  They won the bidding because they were the low bidders.   Why would more established companies want to low bid on a contract that is very, very high risk and very low reward?Puerto Rico is a basket case and it is unlikely that any company will actually be paid in the end.They were the only bidder, actually.  And FEMA is doing some or all of the paying.No they were not. It's great if they're doing a good job. But if they got preferential treatment when getting the job, that's something people deserve to know about. These sort of things should be done with complete transparency to avoid even a hint of shadiness. The Puerto Rican power company has a history of making poorly documented contracts for big $$.  You know pr awarded the contract and that this mayor is talking out of her ass againPR, badly managed and corrupt?Surely, you jest.I'm starting to get the impression she's just using this situation to keep herself in the political spotlight.San Juan Mayor sticks her face in cameras again... still ignores FEMA.She got suckered by inflammatory anti-Trump news trying to pretend that the town this company was from made it somehow related to a Trump appointee. She is known to be delusionally anti-Trump.Yea let's cancel the contract, pull all 300 workers from the country, and go through a competitive bid process that even expedited will take at least a month to complete and another couple weeks to start mobilizing the same number of people back there.  That sounds like a great idea and she sounds like she really cares a lot about the people of Puerto Rico who will suffer even more because of it.  Of course much of San Juan is already restored so it won't be 'her people' who suffer, just the ones who might have voted to reelect the current pro-statehood governor over her in the next election cycle.  Did she get a custom T-Shirt for this occasion?So they are thee doing work, you want to not pay, cancel the contract. They should pull there people out and demand payment prior to workThe country has no electricity. This company was hired to turn it back on. They've hired hundreds* of workers and sent them to PR. They're currently working to fix the grid and this mayor wants to harass them with micromanagement audits while they're working or kick them out just because she doesn't like Trump. This mayor is pathetic. Nothing like playing with the lives of your constituents in order to score political points.300 workers if i read it correctly yesterday.All those working, and there are only 40, are subcontracted from other utility companies in the southern US mainland.  They aren't employees.It's 40 in San Juan only, the company has hired 300+ subcontractors that are on the island already. You dont understand how construction works, i didn't either until it was explained to me. This is what any company would do. These companies sub it  out to others so its not out of the norm.Actually I have done quite a lot of construction.  I am correcting the OP, because the insinuation is that Whitefish had gone to some effort when all they did was contact the Sountern Power Cooperative for people.  They have no people.  They are middlemen.Right.  They are taking all the financial risk to get this done.  That's not nothing, when the utility is bankrupt and has no money.&gt; *They are taking all the financial risk to get this done.*They are taking almost NO financial risk as FEMA is obligated to pay for the contract PREPA signed.And Whitefish's neighbor and pal in the 'everybody knows everybody' town of 6,000 where they both live, Trump-appointee the US Secretary of Energy, was in the perfect position to be aware of that and advise Whitefish before the fact.Whitefish even gave the Secretary of Energy's son a summer job (in a company with no other employees) just before the run-up to September hurricane season.&gt; Whitefish even gave the Secretary of Energy's son a summer job (in a company with no other employees)He was a flagger at one of their construction sites... total corruption right there! /sSecretary of the Interior, not Energy. ~~Secretary of the Interior, not Energy.~~Secretary of The Department of OopsYou don't even have your facts straight. Doesn't make a difference, if I use subcontractors for a job I sold, under the agreement they are for all intents and purposes my employees, my responsibility to pay, ensure safety, and quality of work. I don't get to blame them if they do a shit job.  I can refuse to pay them, but that's a whole other issue.They basically get 10-15% of whatever contract they are awarded. They HAVE to subcontract basically everything (Since they don't have the employees to handle it) and get the fat off the top.that's how contracting/subcontracting works.  this isn't the first time.  Source: Am federal contractor. Of course they are contractors. That's how construction works. Why would they be employees? The 40 refers to one spot. There's over 300 total.&gt; The country.Stop right there.I agree except with the wages of this 2 man companyTo me $268 an hr for a linesman is ridiculous and over $300 an hr for a supervisor.The wages of this company are pretty over the top.They're working thousands of miles from home, doing hard work in a disaster area with no amenities and no security to keep them safe. It warrants high pay.That’s pretty much what linemen make.  It’s hazardous duty, not many people can do it, and few of those want to go to Puerto Rico.  An average lineman working on high voltage transmission towers in the US can make $500k/yr, if they work all year and are willing to be itinerant.  Over 50% of that number is to cover overhead and probably 10% or so is for profit.  It's not what the people working are getting paid.  It depends on how they’re hired.  If they’re contractors, without benefits, travel, or housing, then the money does go straight to their pockets.Yup, the old 1099 vs W2, but you have to know what you are doing.  I have people who work for me that *want* to be 1099 and I let them.  Not for any advantage to me, because if they don't pay their taxes the IRS comes back to me for them, but because they can handle the risks.People who have never actually worked don't understand how skinny it actually gets after everyone and everything is paid.  Your 15-20% O&amp;P is at risk of being nothing or negative.No, it isn't.WTF are you talking about?http://work.chron.com/salary-power-lineman-jobs-3055.htmlI work for a company that does crane repairs on site. You're covering costs of insurance for the workers, costs of fleet vehicles, per diem expenses, office staff, purchasing staff, telecom expenses, equipment rentals.  Depending n the organization they may do a high all in rate or have a smaller more a la carte charge, but for experienced tradespeople that work in the field, the BARE minimum is around 150$/ hour in Canada for just a guy with tools and a truck to show up.They won't listen, they see the number and have already decided it's wrong.  I get it, I've done this kind of work and that 15-20% O&amp;P is at significant risk after everything and everyone is paid.I wouldn't have taken PR, I'll be curious to see if Whitefish pulls it off.  If they do, they earned it.If your office job paid you $20/hr and you were single with no kids would it be insane to consider getting flown out to work in Puerto Rico for $60/hr temporarily?I have friends that are lineman and they do incredibly dangerous shit. The fact that they make $100/hr is more than warranted.Now add the fact that they’re going to be working with dated equipment in dangerous conditions and it seems more than fair to me. In that business if your equipment gives a wrong reading or is faulty you can’t just restart the computer and hope for the best - you die. I also read the hospitals there are pretty bad right now.Do you think Puerto Rico is actually going to pay that?  That's almost certainly not going to happen.  They are in default on all their debts anyway.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/puerto-ricos-electric-power-authority-effectively-files-for-bankruptcy.htmlIf you're going to get paid pennies on the dollar, you better ask for a lot of dollars to begin with.If you are a linemen making good money at home, why would you take a job in a disaster zone without pay that makes it worth your while? Linemen rarely work from home. They are one of the most common traveling trades.How often do they work in disaster zones without clean water?Oh believe me I am not refuting the high pay. Linemen are some of the highest earning tradesmen and for damn good reason.The linemen are getting paid over $100 per hour. Now add overtime, taxes and benefits.The profit is now much smaller.That's a pretty reasonable wage to get somebody to fly out there and do work on that island....  especially when you want things done quickly you're going to end up paying a lotIt has hired hundreds of workers. It isn't a two man company anymore. And that's what you have to pay in order to get experienced linesmen to fly to an island with no power where they have to live in squalor for weeks while they rebuild a power grid from scratch. Let's be honest, it's not like PR will even pay it. Like most of their bills it will just turn into debt and eventually they'll get bailed out. That's not going directly to the contractor; it goes to the contractee, who then pays for costs such as materials, administration, and other overhead, and then pays the contractor their actual hourly rate and pockets the rest as profit. It might be high, but it's hazardous work. Stupid bitch would rather see her own people suffer so she can virtue signal.Do any of you even know the history of Puerto Rico and why its in debt in the first place?Completely spitballing this, but I would assume because it’s a tiny island with no real resources for income other than tourism so it’s had to feed off the US for most of its concerns and therefore can’t repay whatever they owe. That's a good general explanation.  Add to that an incompetent government, and a bit of corruption.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_government-debt_crisisGo ahead and read all about itThanks for that Because of Trump, *obviously*Imperialism, sugar, mismanagement, legal limbo.Probably corruption has a lot to do with it, from both people inside Puerto Rico and out (the US mainland).  You can only hand out so many $300 million contracts like these before you start to sink.  The Mayor of San Juan dines on Coney island Whitefish.I’m conflicted on articles like this, do I upvote for the comments correctly reaming her for trying to further her political career or do I downvote bc I disagree w the article/title?Let's a mayor currently under investigation for corruption and the many complaints against her administration by locals and organizations (including other mayors of PR) wants to cancel a contract.The reason, it's alarming. What specific points of the contract she doesn't list.Let's see what happens if they cancel it. Well most wouldn't do a contract because they have no credit and wouldn't be able to pay much up front. If they cancel this one after the company invested millions and have already started it is going to be more difficult to find someone.Seriously who is going to take a contract this large with a country with no credit worthiness, one that cannot put a big enough deposit done. One that will blame you for anything that goes wrong and might cancel because they suddenly don't like it leaving you owing millions with no way to get it back.Looking for a new contract would delay power to Puerto Ricans for weeks and most likely months. That is IF she can find a better one..According to reports the company is doing a great job. They mobilized quickly and contracted hundreds of people. While the scope of the job, and danger, went up they have done it ahead of schedule and under budget.What reports and by who?What reports? Can you link the documents that state the reliability of the company in question. No quotes from employees of the company please, that is unreliable. Always posing for the cameras, that one. "Oi Vey."I think I found out why Whitefish was chosen over other utilities. Found this while browsing sources on Whitefish’s Wikipedia page. They were contracted to fix lines after Irma. Then Maria hit. In the chaos the procurement employee activated Whitefish for Maria needs.&gt; Whitefish entered PREPA's orbit during the interval between Irma and Maria, the two hurricanes that lashed Puerto Rico this season. Ramos said that it put out a request for repairs to its transmission lines after Irma and that Whitefish was one of only two mainland companies that responded.&gt; Whitefish got the go-ahead to head to Puerto Rico, not from Ramos but from PREPA's procurement employees, who had a satellite phone and Whitefish's phone numberThey’ll not be the only company contracted with either.&gt; Ramos added that, despite PREPA's hobbled finances, it plans to hire companies to fix its grid other than Whitefish. "They won't be the last," Ramos said.https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060063083[deleted]It wasn't a no-bid contract.  Try to get the facts before piling on.I think it's more concerning that for many years the PR govt let their power grid decay to the point where one storm wiped it out completely. They knew they were in a hurricane zone. They should've been prepared for something like this. Nobody else bid on it, different from a no-bid contract.
How do you teach or write a story about racial inequality without offensive racial words? Like hey we can't teach kids about drinking and driving because then we'd have to show them what can happen and that's too graphic. That doesn't matter. Soon enough Elmo will be on the curriculum to make sure no one's feelings are hurt.Some stupid parent will be offended by Mr. Noodle. Goddammit, Mr. Noodle!"But, but, it resembles a *penis!*"To be fair, if they just  assigned it and made kids read it, some ignorant fuck parent would scream racism and try and make a headline out of it.My wife teaches gradeschool kids just a year or two before they hit this book and the half wits that breed in this country are fucking scary. Just this year, she has had a group of parents in her grade trading test banks on facebook and then getting angry when they werent used. Yeah it's getting silly. There's definitely a problem with racism in this world, but there's also a problem with people using racism for no reason also.Like [this](http://www.lulu.com/shop/mark-twain/the-hipster-huckleberry-finn/paperback/product-14451414.html).Wow... I can't believe this is even real... Good findThis reminds me of the ~~modern~~ outcry about Blazing Saddles because of its prominent use of the same word, without understanding or appreciating that the film is entirely about how ridiculous the racism is.  They don't play the word for laughs, but for satire, and the inability for some people to distinguish the two is somewhat sad."the modern outcry about Blazing Saddles"?I read [this article](https://filmschoolrejects.com/19-things-we-learned-from-the-blazing-saddles-commentary-a1779300fd29/) a year or two ago and somehow did some mental gymnastics in my memory that it was a "modern" debate rather than the debate at the time.  Oops!In another year they will ban Where the Red Fern Grows because it is literally assault to make a child experience adverse emotions.I remember reading that in 6th grade and I got in trouble because a girl cried and I told her to grow up because it's just a bookWe read it in 4th grade out loud. When we got the the part where the bloodhound has its entrails pulled out by a stick, I completely blacked out. Got to spend the rest of class in the nurse's office—great book!You must have had some great potential voice actors in your class, because there is no way I could have gotten any emotional feeling from the dry, monotonous tone of 4th graders being forced to read out loud. Great book though!Good, you should have gotten in trouble.I did something similar with old yeller.I thought they were going to have a good 'ole fashioned book burning.Waiting for the day when a school district / board or any other group decides that Fahrenheit 451 is too offensive or inappropriate and has an actual book-burning event. Isn't that illegal as well?? I remember a case regarding this about Harry potter??It's a compromise which allows them to identify malcontents and treat them in a way Jesus would never approve of.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ25-U3jNWMNext we need to get Goosebumps banned. That's right, /u/RL__Stine, we're coming for you next.How better to get kids engaged with a 50+ year old book about an uncomfortable subject than tell them they aren't allowed to read it? Oh boo-hoo, it might make my child uncomfortable.If my kid or any other kid felt offended by the language and attitudes in the book —  good. You should be. That’s what people had to go through before the civil rights movement.Feelings, demanding of comfort for the students, and shitty parenting are ruining education in America.Learning our past is uncomfortable, deal with it and move on.I feel it's pretty hard to ban books in the age of the internet.Can anyone explain to me what the overall lesson is in "to kill a mocking bird" and why that lesson can only be taught with this book, because I just don't get itDon't let your prejudices have such a control over your life that you're willing to let innocents suffer.It teaches that hate will ultimately win if good men do nothing.It teaches us that everyone is a person, for better or for worse and that fighting for what is right isn't easy, isn't fair, isn't clean.It teaches us no matter how hard you try, no matter how good you are, ultimately hate will still do whatever it takes to keep hating.I could keep going, but if you really have to ask after reading the novel in not sure what to tell you.This was my lesson from the book. And I also had the same reaction to the removal of TKAMB from the curriculum. I came across a bit of commentary that took that position, but then questioned whether TKAMB should really be in EVERY curriculum. Basically, their point was - these lessons that we're basing our outrage on are important for the original target audience of the book (white people). What lesson do black kids get from it? Not all white people suck? Not great. If you get in trouble, look for a white savior? That's pretty bad, actually. We learn these lessons because we probably associated with Scout. Black kids might not. Even as kids they might associate with Tom Robinson. I don't know exactly what the demographics were of the school in question; I got the impression it was a predominantly white school and that the "language" issue was counterproductive - if the use of the n-word shocks children, it shows that we've made a ton of progress as a society. But I can totally see why it's the wrong book for a predominantly black school. I'm sure there's other books that both have literary merit and teach life lessons that would better connect with a different audience.Teaching it to everyone includes everyone in our cultural language. The shortcuts we take to communicate. The historical context and discussions about how it was received at the time and what effect it may have had since, are also worthwhile, I think.We can't start teaching black people literal different things just because of how the viewpoint could be. We do however, for obvious reasons, lack a lot of tradition "American Classic" stories where the lead character is black or native and shit.
cable mostly sucks and is too expensive to suck at the level it does. also, wtf is up with the movie channels never showing decent older movies anymore?There are a lot more markets for those older movies.  They've been spread between amazon, hulu, netflix, et al.of the ones you mentioned, i've found that only Amazon has the movies i'm talking about. Netflix rarely has them and i have found Netflix has tons of crap. Really have to look hard to find some good ones.  I used to love "catching" or stumbling on a great older familiar movie by accident when i turned on the tv. Amazon and Netflix do not allow for that same experience (not their faults either).I feel the same about Netflix. It’s turned into wading through piles of crap to find something good. Because rights to content costs a ton more than they did in 2010. Especially as studios and content owners develop their own distribution methods.  The direction online distribution is going will be more expensive for the average consumer than Cable. Until an aggregator comes around and brings you your content in a bundle.  No, streaming won't always be a la carte. TCM needs to come out with a similar service. Their movies are awesome and would be a great alternative to Netflix because Netflix doesn't really have any older movies.I have been begging for this for a minute. It'd be so nice to have and I have little doubt they wouldn't find subscribers for it.The only issue is the worry they'll do one but it will one of the ones you have to have a cable subscription to access. Ugh.What movies are you talking about?Netflix will be a streaming, binge version of HBO inside 5 years. It nearly is today.I have amazon prime but have never used the video service. How is the selection?Movies have a good selection, tv shows have a few good ones but most are things nobody would ever want to see.It's ok. Less than Amazon.  Some good originals.  Some sci-fi stuff.  Doctor Who is currently on Amazon, it used to be on Netflix.  Amazon also has several premium add on packages, like hbo, showtime, stars, british tv, some sports.  The range from $15 down to around $3 extra per month.It is really bad, in 08 my GF and I got into the habit of counting commercials.  I cut the cord in 2010 and can only imagine how bad commercial breaks are now.On some channels, you're looking at anywhere from 5-8 minutes of commercials. I timed them once watching a movie on spike and then again on el Rey network.  Good. This should be on the front page so people know that failing cable companies are spending more on lobbying than providing a valuable service.In The Netherlands I have 150/15mbit (possibly 200/20mbit) cable with 50 mainstream HD channels for €50 a month.. cable doesn't necessarily suck :)Ajit Pai: "It's come to our attention that many people are dropping cable. We've decided to make it a felony to do so."Remember when you googled Comcast and a swastika came up? What happen to that?https://www.google.com/search?q=comcast+logo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpjo_exI_XAhVOfiYKHZQOCcEQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=791Give it a click and visit the page to bump it up in the results.Done. Did my [own](https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/comments/7903mq/comcast_logo/) too. Let's bring her back!I felt really bad about doing that but a cable company justifies it.Reddit stopped pushing it and Comcast whitewashed it so it would go away.We should start pushing it again. Luckily, they both have billions to spend on lobbying to cripple streaming services those customers are flocking to instead of actually improving their service to customers.Comcast owns the means for streaming too so it's all just a fucking jokewhen comcast is purposely throttling or gouging prices, to get a limited basic cable package for 100-120$, it will make people move away from comcast. In sf some are moving towards sonic internet and other similar internet services, way better, no bs tiered service , AND BETTER speed as well.There’s a novel idea.. let’s charge the customers who are sticking with us even more so we can make up for the people who are wising up and leaving. That’s sure to pan out well. Like adding fuel to a fire. I dropped cable 2 years ago and was surprised to find out almost 9/10 people I know have done the same.&gt;Still, Comcast’s profit increased to 52 cents a share, excluding some items, topping the 50 cent estimate predicted by analysts. The company held steady in part by getting customers to pay more -- the average monthly bill climbed 2.1 percent from a year earlier to $151.51.You can only increase prices for so long and then you will bleed even more subscribers.Increasing price and cutting resources for the services means this problem is going to continue to grow. It's funny I think AT&amp;T said cord cutters were mostly over now like it's some sort of fad. What a bunch of dinosaurs. This is one of the reasons they want to kill net neutrality.  Without net neutrality, they'll be able to block or throttle TV streaming services and charge extra for their use, replacing the income they lost from cable TV.Good thing I don't have to use Comcast for internet service...oh waitalso Comcast has started implementing soft bandwidth caps and overage fees in a majority of their markets. It is bullshitWhen you never receive your bandwidth "estimate" to begin with it seems like a pretty shitty deal.I didn't like customer service or how I was treated. If they create bad experiences for me, then that's the end of them. I have no regrets.I had Comcast for about 10 years, in 4 different states, and the entire experience was terrible.  I dropped them as soon as I moved to an area where they weren't the only provider. If I can help it, I'm never dealing with them again.Agreed. I have Verizon Fios now and have never been happier. Comcast tried to give me a termination bill even after I switched, I told them no and they voided it.Remember when people had cable TV?  Pepperidge Farms remembers.Couldn't happen to a more deserving pair of corporations, generally speaking. Cable costs keep increasing while infrastructure quality keeps dropping. Cables in my area are older then god and no replacements are in sight. Cable costs go up because they have to pay for the rights to the media they use like fox sports or Disney. The rights only go up in price and I don’t think they want to give away products. A lot of infrastructure problems start in the apartment you’re renting from, condo or even home. No one wants to pay for new construction to run a new cable line to each room, I’m sure my landlord won’t.  Unless the building you’re renting from has a contract with the cable company you’re basically in the hands of your landlord for decent quality.  Yeah because who the fuck watches cable? Sports peopleThis is a symptom of wealth hoarding.    Basic securities are food, water and shelter.   People are spending more time working to get basics securities.      Cable is a luxury and who the fuck wants to spend 30% of view time on commercials with the limited free time that you do have? Or maybe there's now cheaper and more convenient alternatives? Por que no los dos?Good. Let them crash and burnMost people dont want the forced "tv-cable" package that comcast forces down peoples throat, and they start tier the cable service as well as the internet speed.I'm just waiting for the hd antenna and OTA dvr I ordered and then I'll be cutting the cord myself. Can't wait!It's like a weight is lifted off you! We used the TV for background noise. We'd put something on and get on laptops, tablets, phones... I pay a little extra for gigabit internet but I'm still saving almost $100 a month! Comcast keeps raising their prices so they are making it much easier for people thinking about cutting the cord.Dropped mine for sling TV. I'm very satisfied with it tooI haven't watched cable in over a year. Haven't looked back.My guess is that this represents people switching to 4 and 5G tethering, bandwidth is juuust enough. Cable + internet prices are too high when those data plan rates start looking good. Not to mention the cable part is more redundant when paired to internet vs. phone service.If we are just going by the weight of the subscribers, that's only like 7 or 8 probably.They knew it was coming that's why most have caps now.  Soon those caps will start shrinking.ESPN shows more politics than C-Span now and [Nickelodeon seems to be programmed by pedos.](https://www.redstate.com/kiradavis/2017/10/24/next-big-hollywood-sex-scandal-already-breaking...at-nickelodeon/)I pay $60 a month for Webpass and I'm getting 500mbs... in my area, if I wanted 120mbs through Comcast it would cost me $100 a month. Why would I ever want to be a Comcast customer again for anything?the free over the air network broadcast have excellent reception (1080p).  It is one of the miracles of the 21st century.  you get this free tv with only a sixty dollar antenae from best buy.  Comcast can kiss my big fat hairy patoot.  Losing customers? Raise prices and cut service to make up for it. Sponsor legislation to prevent competition. Repeat.If YouTube TV had an actual app I could install on my Firestick or my actual Android TV I would have dropped cable already. They need to hurry up with the app.Never had a TV for the past 15 years... Finally people started to catch up They'll get them back after net neutrality is destroyed at the hands of Trumpster knuckle draggers, and competitive streaming services become infeasible.Assuming the average person weighs ~150lbs, I'd say they only lost 13.33 customers which isn't that bad.*Craig meme* If Comcast died I would be soooooooooo happyThe only reason to keep cable was sports and the NFL, but the NFL 1) hates America and 2) can be streamed now. The biggest channel cost is ESPN and it’s mostly political stuff now. People can go to political websites for free. 
I think they should try a prayer from a different religion before every game and keep track of which games they won and figure out who is right. Teiwaz, God of War. Please accept our sacrifice so that we may crush our enemies The Ducks. Fuck Teiwaz! All glory to the Dark Mother, Lolth!!!!!!Wha? [Týr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Týr) (alternate spellings Teiws, Tīw, Ziu, Cyo, Teiwaz, Tīwazis) was the god of law and heroic glory.  Although, I guess most of the Norse gods were gods of war in one for or another.I like my version of Jesus to be a rebellious teenager. Dear 14-year old teenage Jesus, with your awkward peach fuzz mustache and squeaky voice. We pray that you defy the odds like your do your Mother Mary and help lead us into the end zone, but not into temptation. Please use your teenage Jesus power to keep our players safe from injury while we crush and smite our opponents with vengeful force. And we look forward to Powerade's release of the new Mystic Mountain Blueberry. Thank you for all you power and your grace. Amen. I like to picture Jesus in a tuxedo t-shirt because it says I’m formal but I’m here to party.I like my Jesus with a neckbeard and a fedora playing magic the gathering and praying behind people's cracks. M'disciples My money is on Odin.Depends on if they have enough humans to sacrifice to Odin.That's what the JV players are for.Most pray for safety and protection.... not for a winLike it or hate it, the law is the law. The supreme court ruled **17  years ago** that public schools are not constitutionally allowed to have prayer over the loudspeaker at football games...even if it is led by a student. You can read all about that case [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Independent_School_District_v._Doe) That has been the law of the land for 17 years. Who forgot to tell Alabama?&gt;The Freedom From Religion Foundation is insisting that an Alabama school district stop the unconstitutional broadcasting of Christian prayers before high school football games.They were also broadcasting the prayers on the loudspeakers.  It's not like a group of kids decided to pray on their own, the school is sponsoring the prayers. Yeah, its a bit much. There was a big controversy in my state when a local coach got fired for participating in prayer with willing students prior to games. I think thats a bit more understandable. I can't imagine why they would feel the need to broadcast prayer over loudspeakers at a public event. Not everyone follows your religion, be respectful. If you want, announce a moment of prayer or moment of silence, don't lead an actual prayer to an audience of random people just there to watch football.Washington State ? Where the coach signed an agreement to stop then continued, not "participating" as you say, but *leading* prayers ? The issue in that case is not only the fact that the coach was calling for prayer, but also how students felt they would be punished if they didn't join in because the coach has power over their playing time. We have had this in our local district. Favoritism was rampant. Go to coaches church ? You're in. No, NJ. The prayers were led by students who wanted to pray and the coach got fired for participating.Ah, that's interesting. "The school district said Borden had a long history of leading prayers before he was ordered to stop after complaints from some parents."From [This]( http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/supreme_court_rejects_east_bru.html) article.And he stopped... he was arguing for the right to take a knee and silently participate after the transition when students started leading the prayers.He started out leading those prayers, then after parents complained, a few students started leading prayers he participated in. I see influenece in that. He stopped leading prayers years prior to the incident in question. The students affected by that wouldn't have even been in school anymore.His case was against the district's policy and that no employee can participate in silent prayers with students.I live where that happened (Bremerton, WA) right now.  He was not only doing that, but doing it in school attire even when he wasn't coaching and he rejected several alternatives (such as being given time to do so independently). Not only that, he wasn't even actually fired...they just decided not to renew his contract just wasn't renewed for the next year. The guy's a scumbag just out to make a fuss/money/Christianst state, depending on your interpretation. I was somewhat open minded about this one until he signed an agreement with the school board to stop but went right out there and did the same thing. No respect for lack of personal integrity. &gt; I can't imagine why they would feel the need to broadcast prayer over loudspeakers at a public event. Everyone wants there own personal Mecca, bruhImagine if the headline read: "School not permitted to use loudspeakers to broadcast prayers at football game" Oh, but then it wouldn't be as easy to rake in the easy clicks, ad revenue, or keep millions of Americans perpetually indignant about made-up controversies!Well, you know high school football is played on Friday night. Maybe schools could hire a muezzin to sound the call to prayer.Need them fancy internet points.The headline in no way indicates that this is a private group of students..."School told to stop"  Who do you think "school" is?  A small group of students?I don't like click bait either but calling things click bait without thinking has become nothing more than a free karma grab. ok that makes sense, while i personally enjoy praying before games/competitions, i understand others wouldn't want to be imposed into that.for some reason i initially thought this was ban to all prayer (but that's what i get for looking at comments and title before the article)*tips at the speed of light till the fedora catches on fire*in 2012 a poll was done of republicans in Alabama, 45% believed Obama was a Muslim, 60% didn't believe in evolution, and 21% thought interracial marriage should be illegal. Apparently we've forgotten to tell Alabama a lot of things haha. edit: source - http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PPP_Release_SouthernSwing_312.pdf&gt;  and 21% thought interracial marriage should be illegalPretty scary these people are even allowed to vote.Ever scarier that they're allowed to reproduce and raise equally messed up kids. Especially in a world that's already reaching capacity in terms of it's resources and the way we're polluting it. &gt; Who forgot to tell Alabama?I feel like that could be the title of a book.American history seems to be a recurring tale of the South being dragged kicking and screaming into modernity.I mean, there's a reason the political left is sometimes called "progressive" and the right often goes by the label "conservative".They are literally against change, pretty much just on principle. More often than not it doesn't matter how reasoned or necessary the change happens to be, either.Certain people of certain faiths often act as if *their* particular faith is above the law. I'm not gonna name names, but it's Christians in America.You’ve obviously never met a Hasidic Jew. True, but unless you live in a very specific part of New York, they tend not to be a problem.The only Jews in my area are hasidics and I don't live anywhere close to New York. They all live in the hood to, kind of its more of a 10 x 5 block radius in the middle of the hood. It's a short breathe of fresh air driving through that neighborhood Are you saying the Jews are a problem in New York?Just the Satmar/UO communities. You know, the ones that took over a school district and fucked everyone else over. The ones that shun anyone that leaves Orthodoxy. The ones that oppress women. The ones that harassed my Jewish high school's group when we toured the area. That specific subsection of Jews.Oh, like the ones spreading herpes and even causing a few deaths with the batshit crazy practice of having a rabbi suck the blood off of freshly circumcised baby with his mouth, that specific subset? http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/07/health/new-york-neonatal-herpes/index.htmlOh. My. God. What. The. Fuck.  Since 2000 in NYC, roughly 20,500 infants have been exposed to this. Yeah, those guys.Well, there's also the folks who overtly abuse welfare. Largest welfare recipients in the nation is a Hasidic community in one of the most expensive ~~realest~~ real estate areas in one of the most expensive (apparently) states for real estate:.[Hasidic neighborhood in South Williamsburg is a top beneficiary of Section 8, but some question whether law is strictly followed](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hasidic-neighborhood-b-klyn-top-beneficiary-section-8-article-1.2639120)DIsturbing to say the least. Religion is a virus.I'm pretty sure they're the ones responsible for those damn "Kars 4 Kids" commercials too.I’m sensing a theme regarding bad things happening when people take thier religiousity to the extreme. Look into Lakewood, NJ if you have doubts.Its not Jewish groups as a whole, small sects that are essentially destroying towns to fund religious services and accuse anyone that disagrees with them as a Nazi/Racist. Its certainly a local problem, and unfortunately it has been a growing issue in those areas.Honestly when people take religion to that extreme it goes from being religious liberty to religious tyranny. I wouldn't be surprised if there were Christian sects in the USA who also do this. You’ve obviously never met a Hasidic Jew.What do you mean *those people*?!?Prepare to be upset. https://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/534/a-not-so-simple-majorityYou mean Alabama-elected US Senator Roy Moore?Edit:  For those who don't believe me:"n August 2017, Moore suggested that the September 11 attacks were a punishment by God for Americans' declining religiosity.[134][132] Moore has also suggested that the Sandy Hook shooting, which killed 28 people (including 20 children), was "because we’ve forgotten the law of God."[135] Moore has also said that suffering in the United States may be because "we legitimize sodomy" and "legitimize abortion."[132] The Washington Post notes that "among the prices [Moore] says this country has paid for denying God’s supremacy: the high murder rate in Chicago, crime on the streets of Washington, child abuse, rape and sodomy.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore#Political_positionsI guess we all better sign up! I would love to serve a punitive GodHe's not Senator yet, just the GOP nominee.He's not a senator, but he is running for senatorAnd, not going to point any fingers here, but *especially* the Christians in the South.I am also not pointing fingers, but my racist uncle Jimmy.Dammit Jimmy!TIL, Christians in America are the only people that are that narcissistic. Not the only, and also not their fault. Christianity has been the main religion of this huge country (Murica) since its inception. It would be difficult for any large group to hold a mirror to themselves. However, they need to hold a mirror to themselves ASAP or they will continue losing followers every generation.Quick break the mirrors!How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't RealThat's happening either way.It wasn't an exclusive statement, I'm not a Christian and I'm pretty narcissistic, if that wasn't made abundantly clearBut...but your user name...IT'S A FAKEIn no way is that what they said.E: No, really. Any amount of reading comprehension will tell you that’s not what they said. Nobody mentioned Christians being the “only”anything until the Dingus above me. If I told you the shirt I am wearing is blue, nobody would reply and say, “TIL, MHM5035’s shirt is the only shirt that is blue.” Put that way, doesn’t it sound stupid?Alabama is 17 years behind the rest of the country. Maybe more than 17.I'll see your Alabama and raise you West Virginia. At least 20 years behind the times.My home town schools ignored the rule not to say prayers every morning for years. I think they still do them at football games. I am confident in my agnosticism, so I could give a shit. Nothing to do with confidence.  I've had too many family members in my life constantly try to convert me to Christianity, despite my wishes. I'm sick of it in my personal life and I don't think I should have to deal with it from the general public as well.  What's so hard about quietly practicing your religion and respecting others?You're preaching to the choir with me. (rim shot)Because the bible says that those who pray should do so quietly in their home and not in public.  Sob you must do the opposite.&gt;Who forgot to tell Alabama?Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tejas. Take your pick.Although, it's possible Alabama forgot, being it's Alabama and all.It is not that anybody forgot to tell Alabama, but that in the 21st century there is a movement to fundamentally reject the Enlightenment. These people are rejecting the movement away from being ruled by Gods and Kings to being ruled By the People, For the People, Of the People. They reject science, education, and equality.Thats a pretty big statement and generalization thereThe rise of authoritarian strongmen in this decade is pretty well documented, as is the rise of authoritarian political parties in Europe (e.g. The Golden Dawn in Greece, the Front National). What is a dictator but a king wearing new clothes? I'd rather be ruled by nobody thanks.**The enlightenment was started by and carried out by Christians ...**It was a Christian movement!The majority of scientists who brought you this world were/are Christians.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology&gt;It held that these pre-game prayers delivered "on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer" are not private, but public speech. "Regardless of the listener's support for, or objection to, the message, an objective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school's seal of approval."Just gonna gloss over this part?They still do it at Tennessee football games. The university not just highschools.Might want to tell Mississippi that. They did it all the time at my old high school.&gt;  Who forgot to tell Alabama?Oh they know. They just don't give a shit.Does this extend to state Universities? If so, someone should tell this to Clemson.&gt;"And, I think if you ask a Muslim parent they would never want to quiet their child in the same way. I want every parent to be given the freedom I'm given."Something tells me their tune would change if a Muslim student wanted to pray over the loud speaker at a football game.Holy shit, can you imagine.Someone even saying "allahu Akbar" would be enough to put the school on lockdown.Yeah, the shitty ones have kind of ruined that phrase. I love to think that a devout Muslim who prays to Meca 5 times a day has the reddit username of /u/PM_ME_UR_ASS_GIRLS It's not like I'd see any in person, all the good ones are covered up! Id bet everything I own that they would freak out.I think this would be the more appropriate answer, especially in school. This seems to be a good scenario for teaching sharing, diversity, and acceptance of others. It's like when Christian fuckwit legislators want to give public funds to religious schools only to realize later that "religious" doesn't only mean "Christian."As a member of the Satanic Temple let me tell you, if they get to pray over the loudspeaker so should we.Ave SatanasGood, it will remove an unfair advantage. What if one team is praying harder than the other? I prefer a game to be won on skills alone and without divine intervention, thank you.Whatya mean? Fervent prayer is a skill for some people.But prayer doesn't do anything. That's not what those Alabamans believe.Hopefully those things will go extinct in the future. I'm tired of people being held back by poor interpretation of ancient mythology. https://youtu.be/mLaTyNe8mg0?t=2m6sLike God gives a shit who wins a football game.i mean, he's clearly not focused on politics, so what else could he be watching?Can't speak for every football team that does this, but usually their prayer revolves around everyone doing their best, no one getting hurt, and the kids having a good time; not "Dear Baby Jeezus, let us score better than the Rivertown Spartans and take home that trophy, Amen".Edit: [Relevant Perry Bible Fellowship comic](http://pbfcomics.com/comics/spelling/)They should take a knee to silently pray in protest.I'd have no problem with that.&gt;He says from a Christian perspective, prayer should be allowed at the events. I wonder what an atheist's "perspective" would be on the matter? Well, I can't speak for the other atheists, but mine is generally, "This religious stuff is dumb, it should go away, and I wonder if Fred Meyer's has restocked Hop Valley yet." Mmmm... Alphadelic.It has not :/What a silly, pointless thing to say. Of course that is what most Christians would want. Unfortunately for him, laws passed 17 years ago disagree with his opinion.As an Atheist, I don't care.  Unless you physically force me to put my hands together or kneel, public praying just washes over me.  Of course I don't see the point, but it can't hurt. If you want to pray, that's a personal thing. Religion is a personal thing. If you have non-christians on your team, it should be a moment of silence where you are allowed to pray if you want.Why is it I have to respect someone right to be Christian, but Christians don't have to respect my right to not be Christian. Luckily I live in the least religious state in the union, I couldn't imagine living in the Bible belt or some place where the majority of people are Christian fascists, or even a vocal minority.That's what my old high school did. There was a moment of silence before the game always. Everyone knew what it was for, but it didn't violate any laws. You dont get it.Freedom of religion means the biggest local Christian denomination gets to use a school event, and school equipment, to broadcast their prayer while the school event is in hold.Not supporting that is an attack on religious liberty./s//or maybe I am penceGood....they shouldn't be praying not everyone is a slave to Jesus. What does Jesus say about public prayer?5 “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.And God says,With what shall I come before the Lord    and bow down before the exalted God?Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,    with calves a year old?7 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,    with ten thousand rivers of olive oil?Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,    the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?8 He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.    And what does the Lord require of you?To act justly and to love mercy    and to walk humbly[a] with your God.I would think a Christian would be opposed to public prayer in all of its insidious forms, as well as shows of piety. But, alas, they aren't about Christ or God, they're about power, influence, and, more than anything else, money. Jesus, if you look at Him too closely, tends to get in the way.“I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”I don't think that passage means not to pray in public, rather not to pray for public display in attempt to impress or for admiration. The keywords being *hypocrites* and *to be seen by others*. He is saying he would rather you pray in private for the right reasons than in public for the wrong reasons.So I'd say a common public prayer is okay, according to the Bible. At least if its for the right reasons, feel free to argue if a sporting event is the right reason.And that definitely does not mean its acceptable at a public school.&gt; He says from a Christian perspective, prayer should be allowed at the events. The problem is he fails to see there are other perspective and religions that are being forced to participate in his Christian prayer.Nobody is telling anyone they can't pray.  You're just not allowed to use public schools to rub your religion on others like a pervert on a crowded bus.Why cant christians pray to themselves and be humble about it instead of getting in everyone's fucking face about it.  Im not a christian but isnt that what jesus wanted or some shit.  If god knows everything why does he need your shitty football-based prayers broadcast over the loudspeaker?  He hears you masturbating for fucks sake he knows you wanna win the big game but he's busy playing his version of sims and your team's just not on his radar.Plus praying before a game is basically admitting that you suck and need help from a magical sky man.What's God's contract buyout amount?  My team is sitting at 5-2 and if the rest of the season goes south, it may be time to move on to another God.  We need a God who can get it done.Hmm try looking into free agent Gods. The Greek ones are RIPPEDDionysus?  In charge of after-game refreshments.Good callI recommend sacrificing a goat.  Worked for centuries....or that you want everyone to have a good game, no serious injuries, and safe travels to and from the game for family and friends.I'm no fan of religion but I find it strange that your comment is being down-voted. Wishing well on people through your beliefs, no matter what they are, shouldn't be frowned upon. You could just say that without invoking magical sky daddy.And you could simply say that you have no tolerance for religious beliefs instead of using belittling schoolyard phrases like 'magical sky daddy'.But by both our comments we've shown our respective maturity levels, and that's that, really...Prayer is fine. Religious faith is fine.School-sponsored sectarian prayer is unconstitutional.It's not much more complicated than that.And don't blast that shit on loudspeakers.And again: OP's original comment was not about the legality of this prayer, but instead used denigrating language to disparage the practice entirely.That's what my response was to.Nothing more.Bringing up the legality of the situation to cover for the juvenile insults lobbed at the faithful does little to bury those words.Fine. We agree. It was insensitive and immature.I have tolerance for faith.I dint have tolerance for one faith using public school events, and public school equipment to force their prayers in others.Or would you be ok with a Muslim prayer before your kids game?  How about one to Satan?I made no comment on the legality of this prayer.I made a comment on someone using the dismissive and insulting phrase 'magical sky daddy' to denigrate prayer **itself**, without them even commenting on the legal situation.I think it’s weird to get upset about that in defense of a religion who’s most traditional elements teach that cosmic justice requires that I suffer eternal, maximal, torment. I know it’s phrased politely sometimes but that’s kind of like... the literal most hateful sentiment humans are capable of conceiving. It maxes out the chart. I think that honest religious discourse is going to have to include insults, because the many religions of the world include moral judgments of other people, many of which are extremely negative. That guy thinks believing in the Christian God is ignorant. Entire churches pray for the day when God returns and gives him the eternal suffering they think he so richly deserved. These are what people actually think. Dialogue between them will involve insulting sentiments, or it will be dishonest. This prayer was the context of the comment.And I notice you dodged the question.would you be ok with a Muslim prayer before your kids game? How about one to Satan?The comment had nothing to do with the legality of the prayer and existed *solely* to make fun of people who pray, generally.Would you not have issue with someone who, in a comment thread on a racially tinged issue, interjected solely to make a racial slur against a certain group?Sure you would, I know.As there, so here.Make fun of people **who feel the need to pray before public school games using public school equipment**.&gt;a racial slur against a certain group?This was in no way equivalent to a racial slur.You e made about ten comments in this thread and ducked any questions about the article.would you be ok with a Muslim prayer before your kids game? How about one to Satan?I don't know a more consice way to describe a man who does magic tricks  and lives in the sky and takes credit for your creation. I think magical sky daddy is pretty accurate. If you have any other ideas, I'd be happy to hear them. The point is, if you want everyone to be safe and have fun and do their best there is literally no reason to brand it with your particular flavour of worship. That's just product placement.I have tolerance for religious beliefs. I have no tolerance for those who think everybody else needs to take part in their religious beliefs.Sorry but I'm not seeing how that is related to prayerPeople generally are not praying to win.  In high school, I played in a league with all religious schools, and everyone prayed together (both teams) for things like a good game, no serious injuries, and safe travels to and from the game for family and friends.Ok that's nice and all It's one of the things that religious people usually pray for.You might not know that given your obvious disdain for religious belief, so I'm happy to educate you on that point, if it's needed.I mean I just figured they could say all those things without bringing God into it, because of the whole explicit rules about exactly that. I would think that good Christians would have the decency to follow basic rules, but perhaps my understanding of morality is flawed since I'm not a Christian.&gt; because of the whole explicit rules the explicit rules that affirm their right to do just that?How is praying going to do that lol. Just be safe.It's just funny that the "keep politics out of sports" crowd loves keeping religion in sports. What color is your fedoraI wear one of those sweet pope hats AKKTUALLYNot what they pray for, ya dingleberry. Everybody in these comments need to learn to disagree respectfully.Could be worse, they could be kneeling during the anthem/s It's a simple concept, yet many religious people still fail to grasp it. The school cannot endorse prayer, especially over loud speakers. If a group of players want to huddle up and pray beforehand that's fine. When it's predominantly Christians ask them how they'd feel if Muslim or satanic prayers were on the loud speakers, odds are they'd be totally against it. You can't favor one over another and there are too many goddamn religions that we don't have time for that. A couple years ago I was at a work meeting that was held at the County fairgrounds and they invoked a Christian prayer before we had breakfast. Being an atheist, It felt weird and wrong, but I didn't say anything. The person speaking wasn't a private employer either, he worked for the local govt. This was in the Midwest btw. Unless they take a knee while doing it| “I'm not the parent that would ever want to silence my child," says Pastor Pate (executive pastor for the tow’s First Baptist Church). "And, I think if you ask a Muslim parent they would never want to quiet their child in the same way. *I want every parent to be given the freedom I'm given* [emphasis mine]."|Ask an atheist parent how they can keep their child free of religion when the religious are allowed to broadcast and enforce their practices even in secular spaces. When atheists are allowed to give lectures on secularist thought and principles and teach evolution in every church and Sunday school (even when the congregants don’t want it), then maybe we can discuss having prayer in public schools.I found the following quote very telling:&gt;“I'm not the parent that would ever want to silence my child," says Pastor Pate (executive pastor for the tow’s First Baptist Church).

I’m for kids learning what people believe and what they do. However, I also want everyone to know that science exists and science is based on pure empirical proof, easily measured, and observed the same by nearly everyone, and excepted until something better comes along.Holy shit, news from near my hometown made it to reddit. We played this team often and I've been hearing all the locals talk about this for around a month now. This is crazy to meIf there is a God, he doesn't give a single shit about your football team.I think this is a good decision. What if you pray to God to win a football game, and He answers your prayer and wills you to win? That’s the system being rigged to give you an unfair advantage! The whole thing stinks of COMMUNISM.Pray on your own damn time, hell you, individually, can pray before the game. But forcing everyone in the stadium/field to pray in accordance to one specific religion before a public school event is real shitty and entitled.This is pretty great.&gt; "I don't think we can empower our kids to be bold and have faith and tell them when they enter school - 'Don't trust in Christ. That's a struggle for me." Lance Pate is executive pastor of First Baptist Church in Trussville. He says from a Christian perspective, prayer should be allowed at the events. Well, good thing no one is doing that. Could you come up with a *more dishonest* characterization?&gt; "I'm not the parent that would ever want to silence my child," says Pastor Pate. "And, I think if you ask a Muslim parent they would never want to quiet their child in the same way. I want every parent to be given the freedom I'm given.A challenger appears. Not praying in private is 'silencing children.' And while we're on this note, I assume Pastor Pete would be totally cool with having prayer to Mecca five times per day over the loud speaker, right?Glad to see that in 2017 in an educated country we still have states sponsoring imaginary friends. Are there not better things to pray about? "God, please stop a child from being raped today even if I have to lose this game."With a larger focus on concussions in football, it makes sense for a religious parent to pray for safety for the playersThis is football in the south. "God, I will gladly rape anyone you tell me to, as long as you let us win this game."Source: I played HS football in Texas.I wonder if they would broadcast prayers from other religions and what the reaction to that would be?Asking god to interfere in a game to rig it so one side wins should be seen in the same light as taking performance enhancing drugs. It's cheating to win. Unless you admit prayer is worthless, but then there's no reason to do it. If you think it works then you are trying to cheat.Jimminy Cricket, if you are there to play ball, play the dam game.  I know plenty of people that want prayer in classrooms, I find this baffling.  A classroom is for learning.  Your Timmy can pray at home,  why take away time from math and reading? People use praying to avoid the task at hand.   [deleted]Did it? Probably linked to Reddit's banning of nazi subs etc.Maybe you confused it with worldnews? They have two million more subscribers.What was it yesterday?They're going to do it anyway. I assume they'll be able to do group prayers before the game?The real question is: how will this effect their record? If they start losing, maybe we should look into this God thing. Maybe they can take a knee during the national anthem to protestPerhaps they can kneel in prayer during the Anthem...Here comes the plot for God's Not Dead 3!I think we should keep religion and schools separate anyways...unless you are learning about a religion's history from a class. I remember in 8th grade a kid in my class was really upset that we were learning about evolution. He disregarded everything the teacher said and kept asking question to make her stop teaching. He disagreed with everything she said too. His dad is a local pastor so I guess he just didn't know any better. However by that age I would hope he knew we didn't come from a fucking person's hands and parts of the bible are more of a moral teaching than an actual scientific teaching.Yeah, America!

Seems reasonable enough... and it is crazy to be news Probably because California just passed a law saying it's no longer a felony to knowingly infect someone with HIV.Yes, it's absolutely insane and intolerable in my mind. CA adopted the law following the recommendation of the DOJ, but I'm sure they'd love to hear your uninformed inputDude, my uninformed ass is just glad it doesn't live in California. yeah california sucks, definitely dont move hereHey that’s Oregon’s joke!Fewer than twenty states have those laws on the books in the first place, so it's likely that California *still* has stricter laws on this than your state does.Cool, but I don't live in the states so....Ah, my bad. I am but a sheltered American.I'd like a reason to not think that it's a horrible thing Umm why? Why would they do that?!! At least if they infect you they can be sued to dust before they turn to dust.It only applies to those who did it unknowingly, not people who did it on purpose. For instance, some people never get tested until it's required, so they only find out when they go do something like donate blood. Their blood obviously isn't getting accepted anyway, but this just allows them to not get charged with a felony if it was a sincere mistake. No need to punch someone when they're down (not to mention the money wasted by incarcerating someone.)People that do it knowingly can still go to jail, though.1. HIV isn't deadly anymore, so your hyperbole is offensive.2. Since it isn't deadly anymore, punishing it more harshly than the same crime with more-deadly diseases was blatantly discriminatory.3. It's still a crime, it's just not such a serious crime that it really warrants being coded as a felony.It’s still incredibly dangerous, just not deadly if you don’t mind all the mediation, the costs associated with it, and the fact that no one will want to be with you when they find out. Actually, people have sex with HIV+ people all the time after knowing their partner's status. This is because, through medication, it is now impossible to transmit the virus if you are following your doctor's directions. For a negative partner, there is Truvada (which is called PrEP) which protects the negative person. For the positive partner, once they are in care and managing their virus through medication, their viral load is suppressed to what's termed "undetectable" levels and at that point cannot transmit the virus.In the US it is not possible to not be able to afford medical care for HIV. There are a lot of subsidies in place for those with insurance (because it's cheaper to subsidize treatment, given the above facts). There is also the Ryan White grant which covers you even if you make absolutely no money and have no insurance at all. No matter what, you can access medical care and management of your HIV infection in the US - and being in care and managing your virus prevents you from transmitting it.Give those facts, it is, in fact, safer to have sex with someone who is HIV+ and properly managing the virus than it is to have sex with anyone else. Because you cannot know that you are negative if you have had sex any time in the last six months, given the window period of detection.Stop spreading misinformation. The alt-Right and their Russian patrons are trying to distract and divide you. Stop propagating the stigma. They want you to be afraid of minorities and each other. Stop allowing yourself to be manipulated. They want you preoccupied with petty squabbles and irrational bullshit.upvote for being the only one one who knows what they're talking aboutHow much do medications cost to treat HIV? Is your life expectancy shortened?A lifetime of medical treatment and daily medication? I would say if one does not disclose HIV positive status to a sexual partner that yes it should be coded as a felony.Then you should argue the same thing for influenza which kills *three times as many people every year*. How many times have you gone to work sick? Or tuberculosis. Or syphilis.Those things are misdemeanors. HIV should be treated the same since it's not even as severe.1. HIV decreases your life expectancy by 13 years. So it is still deadly. Source: http://www.aidsmap.com/Life-expectancy-in-HIV-positive-people-in-the-US-still-lags-13-years-behind-HIV-negative-people/page/3040314/     2. See point 1    3. See point 1The only people in whom HIV decreases life expectancy are those who do not follow their doctor's directions and drug addicts... who don't follow their doctor's directions.For everyone else, life expectancy is the same - and quality of health is higher because they get regular appointments in a clinic.Stop spreading misinformation.You got a source for that? It says nothing of that in my source. So show me your stats otherwise you are just spreading misinformation yourselfand laws like this only serve to further stigmatize and marginalize aids patients...its not 1995 anymoreAs they should. That is not a disease that should be kept secret. &gt;That is not a disease that should be kept secret. Not from sex partners. From anyone else, certainly. Is common decency a world headline nowSadly yes.With the amount of degenerates' influence in the world these days, yes.You post a lot in t_d, don't you?Oh yeah, looking at your comment history confirms the suspicion.Kid's a creep.Common sense?Not really common if you have to make a law about it. Never undestimate people's ignorance.Cue up the Carlin quote...Well, good.  That has been a law in many states for a long time.  Should add Syphilis, Hepatitis, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia to the list too.It'll all be in the RFID data viewable from our Google Glasses hud in the future. In the mean time we should be tattooing people's foreheads.&gt;Generally, these laws do not account for scientifically-supported level of risk by type of activities engaged in or risk reduction measures undertaken. As a result, many of these state laws criminalize behaviors that the CDC regards as posing either no risk or negligible risk for HIV transmission even in the absence of risk reduction measures.https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-releases-best-practices-guide-reform-hiv-specific-criminal-laws-alignIs a police officer going to follow every person 24 hours a day to make sure if they start flirting with someone they'll say they have HIV? If not.. They won't be telling a soul.Well when someone gets HIV from them and it is traced back they have on record that they knew, so to prison they goUp to 8 years in prison seems excessive, given the low transmission rate and the fact that managing HIV these days is relatively easy.  I hope this doesn't lead to people in at-risk populations not getting tested so they can still have sex without the possibility of a jail sentence.Excessive? Nah, there is a point to making the punishment heavy. Deterrent. Don't break the law,and you don't have to worry about it. If the law itself is absurd, then having a harsh punishment doesn't make sense. If the majority agree that it's a good law, the punishment should always be extremely severe. Being untested or ignorant of the law should be no excuse.Except that heavy punishment may deter people from being tested, which could increase the number of HIV cases.  Which is, I assume, the opposite of what people want.&gt; Except that heavy punishment may deter people from being testedDoesn't that apply to every communicable disease? so end the problem by holding people who dont get tested realiable for that law as wellGovernment-forced blood tests for all sexually active citizens.  That will go well.not all blood test for sexually active citizens, when did i say that? or are you trying to blow the concept of holding people who have the desiese or highly at risk for it and refuse to get tested reliable out of proporton?I don't know about requiring it, that should be done anyway. Plus, by having unprotected sex you sort of assume all the risks involved.There is a difference between risk of infection and probable infection. Its a difficult and blurry line as you don't want to stigmatize those infected for seeking treatment.not really, if someone you tells you they dont have any desieses that would lower the risk, then you take into account alchohal that impaires judgement skills and hell take it one step further and consider people ripping condems and stealthing, those are all things that impair someone from truely assuming the risk involved
Good luck to him. Corey has been through hell and I hope he can help children never have to go through what he did.What he went through as a child actor has really defined his career at this point. Hopefully he can make a difference and this can be a way he finds redemption.Godspeed Corey, stand brave and hold fast against the evil to come.  RIP Corey Haim. Imagine how different his life would have been had it not played out the way it did. What's fucked up is that the media has always blamed kids that burn out in the industry and either become druggies, alcoholics or couldn't handle the fame.Maybe all these kids that crashed and burned are actual victims of pedophilia and sex abuse. The way they burn out definitely seems to match child abuse better than an inability to handle fame. It wouldn't surprise me if the fame burnout thing was all made up and spread by the same people that are abusing the children.An effective way to discredit whistleblowers is to expose them to illicit and addictive substances. Just sayin. True, true. People who suffer trauma will self medicate, but it wouldn't surprise me if they did do just that; get the kids exposed to heroin or coke or meth or whatever, and then let the self destruction happen. You make an excellent and sad point.I could believe it. Drew Barrymore was taken to hollywood parties at like 13 and given drugs, which started all her problems.  I wonder when she's going to come forward about abuse.drew Barrymore actually started partying earlier. she used to go to studio 54, that legendary disco in NYC all the time when she was like 5. FIVE. what kind of fucking parent takes their kid to a disco, especially studio 54, which in the 70s was literally the capital of cocaine.It's not even a new thing, Judy Garland had speed pushed on her by the studios during the filming of Wizard of Oz. She did write a book years ago. I don't know how much of an expose it was by today's standards. There may have been things that happened to her she didn't share. But once she was on the other side of it she was fairly public in her stance that Hollywood had fucked her up. I feel like if she comes forward that'll open the flood gates. People adore her, so this will add more credibility to Corey's story. Fuck Barbara Walters for not taking him seriously on this. I feel bad for the guy. He was super talented, smart, and charismatic. I can't imagine what he could have done had this not happened to him and sent him down a spiral. She was check into a mental institution *at 13* so it had started before that :(She’s not some no name actress though, she’s a Barrymore. That’s like messing with Beyoncé’s kid. You don’t mess with Hollywood royalty.[deleted]Well this sounds fascinatingly fucked up. You should do an AMA if you can keep in anonymous enough to be safe.Honestly, I think it's more meant to put these kids in a place where they're less likely to fight back. It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it, though it's not like we haven't known for decades what was going on.Feldman has talked about having drugs basically forced on him as a child. It absolutely is a way to marginalized the victim. And drugs like cocaine and heroin at a younger age really fuck you up, but if you are working and making big dough and they are always available, you never really feel the consequences. Until one day you say something you shouldn’t or try to make a stand over something that is just wrong - and you get cut off. Then the nightmare really begins and you are cast out as a “druggie” and start spending time in Malibu and Napa for 30-90 day’s stints as your reputation takes a nose dive and suddenly your work prospects dry up. Or you die.I know this gets posted in these threads often, but [the video of Dave Chappelle](https://youtu.be/OniNubupbQ4) touching on exactly what you said and calling the environment in Hollywood toxic always gives me chills. Here is an intelligent, sane, seemingly strong man speaking about other intelligent, sane, seemingly strong people who encounter "mental breakdowns" after living and working in such a toxic environment. What's worse is, after Dave took a break from Hollywood, the media and others in Hollywood used the exact same verbiage to describe him that he himself uses in the video. I believe it proves that he's on to something. The elites in that world use dismissive language to describe any defectors to the point that the public sees them as crazy or having mental health problems to the point that no one will believe the things they say. It's a truly fucked up, toxic environment.I remember when Britney Spears had her meltdown and this was pretty much my thought even back then.its also easier to get away with rape if your victim is drugged at the time, and forever thereafter.Roman Polanski stuffed Quaaludes down the 13 year old that he ass-raped.13 years old ! .... Oh, and Roman Polanski is still lionized by A-list Hollywood.There was a scandale in France last winter because he was chosen president of the 2017 Cannes Festival. The shit storm was so huge: on social media, TV and radio. Influencers and politicians even said it "wasn't a big deal" because the girl looked of age ! At the end, Polanski had to resign from the position.Edit: 2017, not 2016Macaulay Culkin....WowAs others have said, it's a common tactic. But if someone's all on drugs and says btw I was molested as a kid, my reaction is "Well, that explains the drugs. How's about we do something about that molester now?" rather than hur hur Hollywood washout. Whatevs. Then type out that little ass emoji guy I can't do.It would also explain why not every former child star crashes and burns like that. Elijah Wood ended up okay, and he's spoken out about how his parents were always around and kept him away from potentially dangerous situations.Wow, it took me until this comment in the thread to realize that the parents of these so called "washouts" most likely had shit parents. You'd think after seeing your kid coked out all the time might make you want to do something about it.Someone like Lindsay Lohan had parents who were just as or more coked out. Shit parents, definitely, though who knows what their own history was. Still not an excuse, though. Come to think of it, Drew Barrymore had at least two generations of drug addicted Hollywood actors in her family before her.Even those who weren't outright abused were invariably in environments not kosher for a child, often around heavy drugs at an extremely young age and irresponsible adults who let them partake, exposed to oversexual situations not appropriate for a young kid, and surrounded by adults who should be taking care of them who are mishandling their money, using them for their fame, and not looking out for their best interests.Even if I wasn't abused I would probably burn out if I had a parent who burned through all my hard-earned money themselves.  That kind of betrayal and neglect will fuck you up and its par for the course for child stars, even ones not getting sexually abused on top of itI'm fucked up from this kind of situation without the fame, I can't imagine what it would be like to have most of the world laughing at you and willfully ignoring your cries for help.Nightmarish, is the best my imagination can do.It may seem obvious to everyone else but I feel like I finally connected the dots. From my experience working with children who have histories of extreme abuse and neglect, substance abuse goes hand in hand with it. That and becoming a perpetrator themselves. I had 14 year olds with histories of raping animals, younger siblings, huffing paint, glue, injecting anything they could, and being raped themselves at an incredibly early age. I don't think I'd drink near as much as I would, had I not taken a position to work with them. I also wouldn't be in the position I am now to keep kids from being that abused. Raping animals? Am I really reading that correctly? As a childhood victim of abuse, I feel so lucky to have not fallen down the rabbit hole of further physical or drug abuse. Granted, it’s also sad to consider having PTSD, a complete lack of trust in people, emotional apathy, and inability to foster relationships as “lucky”. The world can be a horrible place, but thank you so much for the work you do to help the kids in such horrid conditions.That sounds like the hardest job in the world. I’m glad there are good people doing it. I don’t think I’d ever have the emotional resilience to directly do that sort of work. What orgs can you recommend to donate to? Find the local secular foster to adopt agency. They are always in need of formula, baby seats and clothes. Or if you follow a faith, then your local faith based agency of the same sort. God damn. I think I'd cry myself to sleep every night in that line of work. I commend you.I can't believe like everybody in Hollywood been known about the shit forever and ain't a motherfucker say anything, and when somebody did step to the plate, nobody backed them.  Corey Feldman been running around 20 years, everybody thinking he crazy.  He was right the whole time.  Just look at Lindsey Lohan. Everyone loved her, but then they loved tearing her apart even more. It makes sense. Get kids hooked on drugs, it makes them work harder in the short term, easier to manipulation easier to discredit and easier to throw away. Society as a whole doesn't give a shit about druggie kids, and there is a kind of built in apathy towards a kid who was handed everything and lost it. After everything I've seen so far, it still continues to surprise me how despicable human beings can be.Makes you think about what may have happened to River Phoenix Macaulay Culkin comes firing at my mind every time every so often. From being the worlds highest paid actor under 18 at 10 years of age,and his immense heroine addiction (thousands of dollars  a night at times ).I swear we have to see something is astray.Fame getting to your head doesn't fully sit right with me ever,idk why.Compare the parents that hovered over their children (actors) and protected them.  (Brooke Shields &amp; Ron Howard come to mind) Contrasted to  Leif Garrett, Drew Berrymore (She picked herself back up after a long road) and the 3 kids from Different Strokes and all the names we know today for having lost their minds.  [I have no doubt that what Cory is saying is True](https://youtu.be/aKTDqqLoVf0) and I really do hope that this gets the same kinds of traction that the "Me Too" woman have. How many do you think have drugs forced upon them as much as sex?Weren't RDJ and Drew Barrymore really open about how they were given drugs as child actors? I bet it's a lot more common than most of us want to think. :(Probably even more than sex. Judy Garland, for example.I believe when Feldman started discussing what he and Haim went through, he said that they were both forced to take drugs in addition to the sexual abuse they both suffered.&gt; Maybe No maybe about it.Plus, shitty stage parents that *had* to know WTF was going on in some way. No way I didn't know *every fucking person* my daughter spent time with when she was growing up. These star-struck idiot parents left their own children with the wolves. SMH.Many of those parents were participants in abusing and taking advantage of their children.  Why do you think so many child stars get emancipated as soon as they can?I firmly believe that. I was talking to someone the other day about that. If you think about it.....these kids were spent long hours with complete strangers, who were in charge of promoting their careers. What a crazy power dynamic that has to be and then on top of that....the parents of the childhood star might be half a wheel as well. So there's that.Yeah like my boy MacaulayGoonies never die!I hate to be that guy, but it's "Goonies never say die."Im totally down for this. What is crazy is he says MJ totally wasnt a pedophile. Can you imagine the anguish he went through, possibly being falsely accused of that? Breaks my heart to think about it.I’ve never believed the MJ pedophile rap.  I think the guy was just stuck in a childlike mental state and maybe did some weird stuff as a result. I really don’t think he was a pedophile rapist though. Basically....he had very poor boundaries with children for an adult man but I don't think he was trying to fuck them or anything. It was weird, but not nefarious.Yeah, he just wanted to be their friends. He didnt have the adult mentatlity to see them as people inferior to him, they were equals to him and people couldn't wrap their heads around it. But I feel like it makes sense  being he was abused as a kid.This is exactly how Michael was.   He could seem almost autistic to some people due to his peter pantype energy and enthusiasm.   Couple that with an opressive upbrigning and a fit-to-burst creative genius.He was a born entertainer - and more then anything he loved to make children smile because they were his level.And to go deeper - he was forced out of a normal childhood and i suspect everything within him wanted to create and nuture the childhood he was robbed of.This is what I started to believe when that documentary came out with the British interviewer. MJ was weird, ok that's not really up for debate. He definitely had some boundary issues and poor judgement when it came to kids. I think in some respects, he was mentally delayed.He lost his childhood and forever wanted to get it back. How he went about that was the wrong way, and people took advantage of that. Corey Haim said MJ never attacked him, and Mcauly Culkin has said the same. I think it's more about trust, every adult he knew left him to be abused and destroyed as a kid. Wouldn't surprise me if the dad left him with music execs and other people to secure deals and make more money. I suspect he simply didn't trust adults and in the future never could either so the only people he felt safe around were kids who well, wouldn't want to and wouldn't be able to do anything to him.That he seemed to be friends with so many kids who also seemed to have been abused maybe also suggests that it was as much a support group as him seeking friendship./r/conspiracy notes that [to those who owned "his" assets, Michael Jackson was worth far more dead than alive](http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7262698/michael-jackson-estate-billion-dollar-turnaround-sony-atv) &gt; the posthumous documentary Michael Jackson's This Is It, released four months after Jackson passed in July, 2009, went on to become the highest-grossing music documentary of all time, with worldwide box office in excess of $300 million&gt;&gt; ...&gt;&gt; Estimates of posthumous sales in the first five years after his death were in excess of 13 million in the U.S. alone. Considering that Jackson has consistently sold an estimated 70 percent of his records outside of the U.S., total sales since 2009 have easily surpassed 43 million worldwide. That makes Jackson the No. 1-selling global artist over the past seven years, surpassing such contemporary superstars as Adele and Taylor Swift.And [some conspiracy theory analysis of his insurance](https://vindicatemj.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/the-story-of-michael-jackson-aegs-fabrications-and-two-medical-examinations-for-insurance/). MJ spoke about this very clearly actuallyI believe MJ went through everything that the rest of the child actors did. Awful parents, drugs pushed on them young, sexualized at a young age, overworked, etc. Child abuse fucks people up. Edit:I mean, just look at normal people. I was physically abused and ended up with borderline, panic disorder, and whole slew of issues. Other adults I know who were abused past the "normal" slap on the mouth when you back talked ended up similar. Kids are new people. Little balls of clay that if you fuck up and form wrong young they are going to dry into fucked up adults. You can definitely fix that when you're older and self aware, but child actors don't get the same chance as "normal" people do because they are constantly under a spotlight and scrutiny while we can fuck up and bounce back and work on ourselves without anyone laughing at us. I always thought of it as tying the branches of a young tree and letting it grow. Later, you can start to untie some of it, and it can start to grow more normally, but those branches will always be out of place. That's how I feel at 45 yo anyway. Wow that's a fantastic analogy. I'm 40 and starting to realize that years of therapy and medication haven't and likely won't change some fundamental things about my perception, all warped by repetitive childhood trauma. But the idea that the branches can grow normally is a good metaphor. That's the thing: When MJ hung out with kids, he really did just think of it as hanging out. Not saying it's "normal", but He genuinely didn't realize he was doing anything wrong.Michael saw himself as a kid in a way. These kids were his friends and he wanted to be apart of their lives. Before the kid accused him, he actually liked spending time with the kid's family. He used to do chores around the house (laundry or taking out the trash) and help the kids with homework. One of Michael's employees told the press that Michael was actually interested in Evan's wife, June. Michael gave her a 'love' bracelet on a trip to Morocco. Personally, I think Michael just wanted a family. My mother, who was a huge MJ fan, always believed that it was because he never had a chance to be a kid as a kid, because of his father slave driving him and his siblings.There was a depthhub post about how it was all fabricated by a dentist who drugged his son into believing it happened to sue MJ and ruin his career/make a payday. Doesn't help MJ that he literally had a ranch full of kids... All it takes is one accusation, his heart was right but his mind didn't think think that through.The last bit is the saddest part of the story to me. On top of all the fucked shit involved with that, he was just trying to be a good guy. He wanted to give kids good childhood experiences because his had been less than positive and I genuinely believe it was a legitimate thing. No good deed goes unpunished. I always felt like he was drawn to kids because he never had a childhood and it was his way of making up for that.  Like, yea he has his quirks but with his upbringing, superstardom, vitiligo... no one was gonna leave that totally "normal".  What exactly happened to him?Other actors have said that it was pretty common entertainment industry knowledge that Corey Feldman and Corey Haim were "passed around" among the pedos ... sick fucking people.How can something so destructive - to *children, no less* - be "common knowledge" and not reported to police?Money. Lots and lots of moneyNo, you’re wrong. It doesn’t take the dream of riches, it just takes a lot of average people to be afraid of losing an average paycheck. Easy, everyone hears about it but one sees it. No one can do anything about gossip, you can't go to the police as someone with third hand knowledge and you can't act against those people through the industry without being accused of taking part in a witchhunt with no evidence."People always ask me "Did you know about Saville?" and the answer is no. "But people say it was basically public knowledge at the BBC that he was a paedo." It wasn't public knowledge. It was a rumour, but people didn't actually know he was. Are you really going to believe a single 13 year old audience member who comes out without any evidence straight away? No, you wouldn't. You'd try and investigate, as many friends of mine did, but if every other victim stays quiet, via either continuing to trust his promises of "I'll make you famous" or threats of "I'll ruin your life", then sadly you don't believe the victim and just ignore it. And that's how the rumours start, from a lighting grip saying "I heard x is investigating Saville for being a paedo". So when people say it was public knowledge, it wasn't. We heard rumours, but rumours without evidence. There's a difference between 'I heard' and 'I knew'. If I knew, if I had an audio recording or some other type of evidence, I would have done something about it. But the truth is, that the only people who really knew were a) him and b) his victims. And sadly, to put him down while he was alive would have required random unknown to the public 13 year old audience members, who had just been assaulted, to go through a 2 year long court case. I'm a grown man and I don't know if I could sit through all that."\- Ian Hislop, just after the whole Saville thing came out.As far as I know he has never given specifics, but it's safe to assume he was molested by one or more Hollywood Execs. The film he is trying to get the funding for may be where he tells all.I hope he dont wake up dead. He literally said this makes him fear for his life. He also passed on a bunch of names complicit in Hollywood pedophile rings to an unnamed person should something happen to him.  Of course it'd be an OD or suicide attemptHoly shit for real. I'm sure there's a real-life, Ray Donovan, fixer-type that handles this shit.Ray Donovan was also diddled I hope he goes after Barbara Walters for being a victim-blaming apologist. For those who are not aware, Walters was interviewing Feldman on the View a fews years back. She accused him of 'trying to destroy an entire industry' in response to him coming forward about the rampant pedophilia problem in Hollywood.  Round up all the childhood stars, grab a pitchfork, and start exposing Hollywood for what it is......one huge cocaine fueled gang bang full of powerful people, pre-nups, and photoshop abusers. I vaguely remember this...I said this recently but he comes off as a little nuts. People need to remember why he is the way he is. Plot twist...maybe Michael Jackson wasn't touching kids. Maybe Michael Jackson was a kid who was touched. Maybe that's why Corey Feldman and Michael Jackson were such close friends.Feldman has maintained that Jackson is one of the few that didn't try to touch him over the course of his childhood.  So, it's possible. Um, I'm pretty sure Michaels case was laughed out of court. Isn't it a general consensus that the accusations surrounding him were just parents trying to make a quick buck?Edit: I'm gonna need the sauce if y'all are posting facts about thisI haven't been able to find it, but there used to be a dude that would go around and post some interesting shit about the MJ case in various related threads. If what he'd posted was true then Michael Jackson basically got screwed over by a shitball attorney that was trolling for dollars.The user's name was /u/jonloovox.  Here's the comment in full.  I've copied/pasted in other threads as well, but he's the author:The story is rather tragic. I do believe that had the internet existed in 1994 in it's current form, Jackson would still be alive today. Jackson was very much the victim of public perception. Yes, he was clearly an eccentric with many quirks, but the "child molestation" thing was hogwash. GQ published a non-bias article in 1994 entitled "Was Michael Jackson Framed?" that you can find all over the net. Here's one link: http://floacist.wordpress.com/2007/08/22/gq-article-was-michael-jackson-framed/ ... It's a pretty fascinating read that details exactly what happened during that first accusation. Most people haven't read it, though... because it's easier and more "interesting" (and at the time, "funnier") to imagine him as some kind of freak.Anyone unfamiliar with what actually happened there, I'd really recommend reading it. The TL;DR: version is pretty god damn fucked up. He befriended a young boy, his mother and step-father. The biological father wanted money to produce "Robin Hood Men In Tights" so he brainwashed his son with sodium Amytal in an attempt to extort money out of Jackson... knowing full-well he wouldn't want to go through a long career-tarnishing trial. There's taped conversations between the father and step-father where the father lays out his entire plan.“And if I go through with this, I win big-time. There’s no way I lose. I’ve checked that inside out. I will get everything I want, and they will be destroyed forever. June will lose [custody of the son]…and Michael’s career will be over.”It's whack. Seriously... read it. FYI, the father ended up killing himself in 2009 only 5 months after Jackson died: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_ChandlerMy point is, public perception in 1994 was so heavily dependent on shock media, magazine covers, radio, talk show monologues, etc. Had Reddit existed back then, we would have seen the smoking gun. People would be chatting over the details on a daily basis. It would have been very difficult for the public to remain that misinformed and warped by rumor and heresay.But the perception stuck. And clearly it weighed heavily on Jackson... someone who had dedicated his life to helping children in need. He was clearly depressed. He turned to drugs. As we later found out, he needed to be medicated to even sleep. I can't imagine what that had to have been like..That was the only time anyone ever accused Jackson of wrongdoing... until 11 years later in 2005, but this time it was CLEARLY bullshit and a clear attempt at extortion. Anyone following that trial was aware of how ridiculous the claims were. I'll summarize. It was right after the huge documentary "Living with Michael Jackson" that Martin Bashir did. Jackson was all over the news for the "baby dangling" incident. In the documentary, it showed that Jackson took in a young cancer patient, his mother and sister and was paying for the boy's treatment (last I heard, he's now cancer-free). He was close with the boy and the family. It made the news, because of the scene where Jackson says, "What's wrong with sharing a bed with someone you love?" in reference to the young boy. The public took it (or twisted it) to be a sexual thing... Jackson intended it as an innocent remark... hanging out late playing video games on a massive bed and someone passes out. Inappropriate? Maybe. Molestation? No. Anyways... the mother of the boy had been in and out of mental institutions and had attempted to con money from celebrities in the past (the reason for Jay Leno and George Lopez being at the trial). She also claimed her family had been "sexually fondled" by JC Penny security after her punk kids shoplifted... she settled out of court for $152k. So anyhow, the Bashir documentary was a shitshow, people like Gloria Allred were petitioning to have Jackson's kids taken away... and Jackson's handlers told him to distance himself from the young boy and the family... so he cut them off. It was only after that, that the woman and the boy accused Jackson of misconduct. The funny part was, they literally claimed the molestation started AFTER the documentary aired. As if Jackson hung out with the kid, let them live at Neverland, passed out playing videogames, filmed a documentary admitting that it was innocent... and then when the entire world started looking at the relationship with a magnifying glass and wanted to take away Jackson's kids (and apparently the family had already been interviewed by police)... THAT's when Jackson decided to start molesting the kid. Come on... Whole thing was a crock of shit. The woman also claimed they were held hostage at Neverland... to which they pulled up the creditcard receipts showing all the shopping sprees she was doing with Jackson's money during the "kidnapping". At one point they point out, "How could you be kidnapped if you were shopping at Nordstroms, Tiffanys... here's a receipt for a body wax". The woman snapped back , "IT WASN'T A BODY WAX!!! IT WAS A LEG WAX!! HE'S LYING TO YOU!!!" .... Total shitshow. Read up on it. It's was fucked. You can read most of this on wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Michael_JacksonThat 2005 Trial doesn't happen without the 1993 situation. It was the same DA (Tom Sneddon) who tried to get Jackson in 1993 that was pushing for the 2005 thing. It was only mildly plausible, because of the 1993 thing. They tried to find other boys to step forward (out of the thousands who Jackson had been in contact with over the years) and nobody stepped forward. They had a former body guard (who had sold his story to National Enquirer and had previously been arrested for armed robbery) claim he saw Jackson blowing Macauley Culkin in a shower... they brought Culkin up there to respond and he's like, "WUT?" ... As one journalist put it:"the trial featured perhaps the most compromised collection of prosecution witnesses ever assembled in an American criminal case...the chief drama of the trial quickly turned into a race to see if the DA could manage to put all of his witnesses on the stand without getting any of them removed from the courthouse in manacles.""Nobody following that trial was surprised by the outcome.It's some sad stuff, man. Despite this, the perception stuck. People continued to hate him and paint him as a monster. People continued to take the rumors and tabloid gossip as truth... and I think ultimately it killed him.Edit: I should admit I'm slightly bias... my cousin spent a lot of time at Neverland hanging out with MJ when she was a kid and she said it was ALWAYS filled with children (mostly underprivileged kids, children with disabilities or sickness) and that Jackson was a fucking saint. She's still depressed about his death and doesn't like talking about it.Edit 2: Someone forwarded this to me. A short interview from 2003 with the author of that GQ article (Mary A Fischer) right after the second allegations broke: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIxU3cWkqW0 ... In the interview, she points out a detail I forgot. In both the 1993 and 2003 allegations, the parents' first instinct wasn't to go to police... but to lawyer up. In both instances, they went to the same lawyer (Larry Feldman) who specializes in civil litigation. Strange behavior if you actually think your kid has been abused.Edit 3: Regarding 2016 child porn allegations: That was a false story fabricated by the tabloid Radar Online.Almost immediately after the "report" went viral, the police department who did the investigation, denied releasing any report.All the porn that was found in MJ's possession was presented at the 2005 trial. Not only was there no child porn, but all of it was heterosexual adult porn.http://michaeljacksonallegations.com/books-magazines-and-internet-material-found-in-michael-jacksons-possession/The prosecution spent days displaying the magazines that they had confiscated from Jackson’s bedroom on a big screen. Observers wondered what point they were trying to make with the detailed, graphic presentation of this completely legal collection that only pointed to Jackson’s sexual interest in women, other than perhaps trying to publicly humiliate him and prejudice the conservative jury against him in the absence of real, relevant evidence.Oh, and the FBI investigated Michael for 15 years. Not one shred of evidence of child molestation or child porn was ever found.Can't believe that even years after his death - tabloids continue to fabricate stories about him. Just disgusting.I went like the last year thinking he was a pedophile cause of those child porn documents they found in is home. Now I'm learning those were fake. Makes me feel so much better about MJ. Bashir in my opinion is the asshat that was directly responsible for MJ's demise. He turned that interview into making him look like a crazy maniac, and worst part is that MJ had trusted him and let him in to his worldTake a look at Louis Theroux's documentary about trying to get access to MJ for a documentary. It's a fascinating view of the hangers-on and circle of parasites that surrounded Jackson and regulated his public life. Yuri Geller stonewalls Louis, accuses him of being an instigator and someone who paints people unfairly, and it's eventually wrung out of him that he's signed up with Martin Bashir for an exclusive interview. We all know what followed.Anyway, at the end of Louis' documentary, he returns to Geller, and grills him about denying Louis while allowing Bashir, who got Jackson to open up, and then absolutely slayed him with implications and innuendo. Honestly, I think Louis would've been the perfect person to make a documentary about Michael Jackson, he's got an incredible talent for humanizing and getting his audience to empathize with controversial or bizarre figures.Bashir on the other hand was mainly famous for the "shock" Diana interview, which was pitched toward generating maximum controversy.Michael was a weird dude, but that's because he was robbed of a childhood, he had money and wanted to give others what he didn't have.It's doubtful he'd be alive still, due in part to still having issues from the Pepsi accident. But they raise very good points, he was a victim of people wanting him for his money. That's all they saw was $$ nothing else.I was 10 in 1993 and 20 in 2003. I'm 33 now and ever since the original alligations, I've always felt that Jackson molested children and somehow got away with it, purely based on how the media portrayed him.This comment has completely changed my opinion on that. I feel terrible now. I suppose you could justify it as being young and uninformed, it doesn't change the fact that I was swindled by the media, and even worse Jackson paid for it with his life.Man. Boy was I wrong.That might be true, but it's definitely not the general concensus. Most people still think he was a kid toucher. At least that's a pretty common joke. Michael was definitely abused as a child, not sure about molested.I heard his dad had sex with girls in the room while Michael watched/slept. It sounds like a pretty fucked up upbringing and there definitely seemed to be some sort of sexual aspect, whether Joe was using Michael's fame to get laid or whatever. Poor kid probably never really had a shot at a normal life.His brothers too the older ones. His dad used to make him sleep in the fireplace and kick the fuck out of him and his brothers.When I watched a documentary about Michael I think it mentioned that his brothers were the ones who were having sex with girls whilst Michael was in the room. It also said that his dad was physically/mentally abusive. We probably wont find out the truth and either way its still pretty messed up.Their earliest gigs were at a strip club. Probabaly not an exactly healthy experience. Joe let Michael read Playboy magazine as a child. He pushed his son into situations he didn't want to do and he always called him ugly. He was a terrible dad.Joe Jackson was a piece of garbage.The kids were all abused and complicit. The industry got paid off of the abuse and silence.America remembers the sweetheart Jackson family.Happy Holidays.I thought he was nuts....then i watched a few interviews. He actually comes off as a pretty smart dude. Well spoken and polite. I would label him "eccentric " but def not nuts.you clearly didn't see his musical performance. I'm not even trying to kid. It was like channeling Michael Jackson but in this very weird way.There was an ama awhile back with the guy that MJ "touched". IIRC the victim said it was his addict mom that did all the crap and MJ was the only victim in that mess. I'll look for it and edit this post after I find it.Dude had money. He also took care of a lot of sick kids. I mean, if we all have it wrong, I really hope it comes out.I was a kid during the early 2000s and as I've grown up I've felt bad about a lot of the jokes I made about people like MJ or Brittney Spears or Lindsey Lohan or any of these other child stars. Yeah, it's seriously fucked up when all along we've been making jokes about MJ when Cosby, Jimmy Saville and others were getting off scott free.I have the theory that MJ was only fascinated with children because of what he went through and didnt get to have himself, so he saw something precious in the innocence of children and wanted to attempt to experience himself.I see it in other parents too, not to the scale that MJ did (but they don’t have his money either), who try to give their kid every fun thing they want because their own childhood sucked. Guilty. I buy my son way too much shit because I grew up in poverty and know how shitty it feels when you can't afford something you want.He wanted the childhood he was robbed of. Have you listened to his song “Childhood”? It’s pretty clear in saying just that. Your "theory" is exactly what Michael says. He was very open about not getting to experience childhood due to his abusive Father and that he wanted to give children the childhood he never had. I’ve always thought it was obvious MJ was so crazy and obsessed with childhood because he was abused and was genuinely and innocently child like. Sort of a raped Peter Pan.I'm highly convinced that MJ was abused as a child and in addition to being falsely accused of molesting children was also silenced and persecuted because he would have exposed the inner workings of the industry.  Additionally he was blackmailed by that family that accused him but that alone does not explain the whole incident. Ironic, Michael Jackson was the only one not touching kids. Much like pastors who decry homosexuality, then turn out to love dick; many Hollywood elites would have condemned Michael while all the while being the real criminals. Who know what the truth is, but I don't think that's an unlikely plot twist. I think people have been supposing that might be a truth for a some time. We will never know :(And maybe he was trying to protect the kids.“Maybe”? You should look up one of the mega gilded posts summarizing how the accusations against Michael Jackson were certainly fabricated by a guy trying to extort money[Link for those curious](https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3n3rio/did_michael_jackson_actually_molest_kids/cvknk28/)They ran this poor guy through the fucking mud and most of the world buys it.  ~~Shit, even South Park made their portrayal about him to reflect this as did so much of pop culture.~~Reddit gets angry when they read a news post where some poor guy spends a year in jail because some child falsely accuses an adult of touching them but the same discourse was not granted for MJ.  He was an eccentric and clearly abused and emotionally stunted individual that likely did little wrong but pop culture dragged him through the mud and nobody was there to help him.  His life must have been harrowing from beginning to end and TO THIS DAY, even after death, he's treated like the scum of the earth.  I cant even imagine it.  I really cant.  I would fucking kill myself if I were abused, then accused of being the very thing that traumatized me irrecoverably all because I tried to make a safe place for kids and make the lives of children better.  What a fucking kick in the gut.And I'm not claiming to be on some higher ground.  I absolutely bought into what the media fed me and I didn't do my own research until waaaay too after the fact.&gt; South Park made their portrayal about him to reflect this as did so much of pop cultureSouth Park clearly made him just a weirdo who wasn't an actual oedophille and was victimized by having his childhood stolen from him. They didn't buy the narrative at all.Comes off as a little nuts... Yes I would imagine being molested as a child would be particularly damaging to one's psyche. Yeah, that clip was gross. I have no idea what she was thinking with that phrasing.Edited for link:https://youtu.be/rujeOqadOVQAnd Ron Swanson is sitting there thinking "I want to strangle everyone in this room."This is it - the video where Barbara Walters tells Corey Feldman "You're damaging an entire industry!".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rujeOqadOVQ Important note, at the end of the video it comes out that Corey's friend, Michael Jackson, did not try to do anything with/to Corey.    It isn't just Hollywood. Time and time again we have seen this *exact* pattern of behavior in a wide array of wealthy and powerful organizations/industries/etc. Hollywood, the State and Federal governments, corporations, religious organizations like the Catholic church, Jehova's Witnesses (and on and on), etc. It's an incredibly disturbing realization. It seems not uncommon for sexual abuse of adults and children to arise within power structures. Thank you. I see so many people trying to make child molestation and sexual abuse into a Hollywood problem when it is in fact a power problem. When you make enough people enough money, those people will defend their interests, even if it means turning a blind eye to abuse. Even taking children out of the equation, it still runs rampant among adults.  Look at a lot of businesses out there where some manager or higher up uses their power and status as a way to lure someone in.  It's sadly relatively common in any group that has a lot of people and a big difference in power.Justice For Corey!Justice For All Coreys!Corey Haim :(He was marginalized by Hollwood.  They totally dropped him like yesterday's news.  It's pretty heartless.  I hope he finds something good from this. He bummed a cigarette off of me back in 94. I offered one to his girlfriend (Casey Kasem's daughter) as well and he was pretty grateful for the courtesy. I was thinking he was going to walk away but instead had his cigarette with me and chatted for a few minutes. Very down to earth and probably one of the nicest celebrities I have ever met. More power to him.I always got the impression he was completely misunderstood. Just likes what he likes and isn't ashamed of it, and people laugh at him for it.That's aside from the obvious blacklisting of him and original issues he had to deal with. The fact that he's alive and functioning in life says a lot about his strength of character, no matter what people think about his music or style.I feel like I grew up with the Coreys. Goonie for life!Edited to add on the OT: I do wish he would just tell his story straight to the camera and put it out, but that also might be too painful for him still. The impact would be stronger with the simple approach, though, I think.There is something so soul sucking about this.CF has been turned into a pathetic, walking punchline. I'll forever remember the Vice article where their reporter attended his underwhelming "Angels" birthday party, because I laughed along with the rest of the internet when it came out.But laughing and moving on is easy. What's a lot harder to reconcile is viewing it as the end result of a whole lot of pain dealt to a boy--far too much, far too soon. The end result of which is a rudderless and damaged man, set adrift in life in a way few could really understand.I can only hope some form of justice comes from this, for him and for the countless other victims with even less of a voice.Part of the reason Feldman has had such a hard time is because he has been blacklisted by the entertainment industry for speaking out.  Everyone knows that if they work with him it is career suicide.Outing evident pedophilia is social suicide.What a world we live in.*Career suicide, not social suicide. It's been happening since minorities could be employed. Nothing new unfortunately."Oh you want to be an executive secretary? Guess what else you have to do... And if you tell anyone, don't plan on having another job anytime soon".It’s also a good lesson for those of us that are impressionable, to not laugh just because others are laughing. It could’ve been a mere chuckle that came out of me or I could’ve just seen it as a failed party that’s not funny, or a small get together, but I didn’t. He seems to be on an upswing lately really. He looks good when I saw him in a video most recently.I completely believe Corey Feldman.I worked in Hollywood at a major animation studio for 8 years.  And while what I saw never involved pedophelia, I exeperienced a culture of abuse of power that has now finally been documented with irrefutable evidence (actually admissions by studio head Ed Catmull of Pixar Studio) and which led to a $170 Million settlement between 2016-2017 in a class action lawsuit involving multiple top studios for forming an illegal cartel to suppress worker wages and mobility.  They broke anti trust laws for the sake of wage theft: http://www.animationlawsuit.com/faqs.aspxI believe studio executives to be morally bankrupt enough to abuse their power for the sake of personal gain, padding their own profits, and derive whatever other desires they may have simply because they wield so much power in an industry that has so little transparency in its practices.I worked in entertainment - and while we may make some of the best stuff in the world, the money and power behind is also fosters the worst of people imaginable.&gt; They broke anti trust laws for the sake of wage theft:So did most of Silicon Valley, for decades. This is a common thing in industries that use highly skilled and specialized workers. tehy realized that bidding against each other was expensive, so they moved to trying to nail them in place and collude to keep wages down through anti-competition agreements and non-disclosure contracts that prevent anyone from hiring a worker after they leave an employer.In fact this animation lawsuit is directly connected to the Silicon Valley Google wage theft class action lawsuit. That’s why the attorney fees were reduced in the animation suit because all the work was already done.  Could this, at least partially, explain why so many child actors turn to drugs and alcohol and other bad habits when older?Mara Wilson, the actress who played Matilda, wrote an excellent article a few years back that you might appreciate:http://www.cracked.com/blog/7-reasons-child-stars-go-crazy-an-insiders-perspective/Holy shit that website is bad on mobile... but it was a very interesting read, thank you. Kept sending me to random ads on different tabs, any time you try to scroll by touching an ad it would open it. I’d read the article but fuck that shit. "Corey Feldman launches Kickstarter to fund documentary on Hollywood pedophilia" is a more accurate title.Edit:  This is really more commentary on the headline than it is on Feldman.Yeah he lost me when I read "I'm gonna expose these guys! ...in a movie. If I get 10 million dollars."But isn't he worried it might damage an entire industry!?^^^^^^/sThanks for that Barbara.Also thanks to Whoopi "It's not 'rape-rape'" Goldberg Huh? She didn't, did she?Oh, yes https://youtu.be/nZskUvAGyjQBitch, it's rape  What a fucking idiot.  She was 13, Whoopie, you goddamned moron.  I never want to hear her talking about anything again.  Roman Polanski got a 13 year old drunk, drugged her with quaaludes, and anally raped her while she couldn't resist. (Being drugged and all.) Gosh if only it wasn't so morally ambiguous. :(Definitely don't see the video of her at the Anne Franklin museum then. She's so bad with words, there's no way she'd be in the video if she wasn't famous Edit: yes Anne Frank. I'm an idiot Anne Frank?She also defended Chris Brown.What a dummyHonestly, The Views pannel is so toxic I can't believe they've been on the air for so long. And do their viewers not pay attention to the trash that comes out of their mouths sometimes?You mean like [this](https://youtu.be/a8INEYLFWwc?t=26s) or [this](https://youtu.be/80JqoyaL-p4?t=1m6s)? Two for one Osborne special.That's why she don't have eyebrows. Get the fuck outta here with that downplayin bullshit. Having sex with a 13-year-old *is* fucking 'rape-rape'!Not only that. He drugged her first. If she had been an adult, it would have been rape.Ya she did :/Did she actually say that?  Wow.https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/29/roman-polanski-whoopi-goldbergGod damn it, Barb.Frigg off Barb.RIP Mr. LaheyAw. Now I'm sad.I want him to succeed. He was a hell of an actor when he was a kid and I just want him to be okay and vindicated so he can move on with his life. It's mindblowing and sad, really, to think about the 'cool kid' from those movies I watched being abused and turned into a victim. People are seriously messed up, sometimes.investigate bryan singer, how did people forget the news around him a couple years agoThey didn't forget, they don't care. Terry Richardson was a well known, serial molester of the woman he photographed and they just dropped him. It's been openly published for ten years now. Re-launches. He brought this shit up DECADES ago and he was shunned for doing so. You guys been seeing how many pedo rings have been busted lately? Im pretty damn hopeful.Wonder if Macaulay Culkin had similar events happen to him?Plausible.  I imagine very few child actors make it out without damage. This is the tip of the iceberg. I know Elijah Wood has commented on it saying its true that it does happen in the industry. One thing about working in Hollywood I could never stomach. All the damn Pedophiles.If Ashton Kutcher can set up his own human trafficking organization and appear before Congress, then Feldman can launch a campaign to expose Hollywood's pedophile ring and end this madness once and for all. I wish him well.&gt; If Ashton Kutcher can set up his own human trafficking organizationMight want to rephrase that since it makes it sound like he's the one trafficking. Ashton Kutcher, human trafficking? Yeahhh they didn’t word that very well. It came across as Kutcher doing the human trafficking instead of him running an ANTI-Human trafficking group*anti*-human trafficking. Let's make sure to make that distinction.Corey - even if no other child stars come forward, I believe you! You aren’t doing this alone, you have us. He has apparently tried this several times over several years.  I wish him luck.  I hate how everyone has mocked him.  He comes off as a very strong and fun loving person despite the tragedies that befell him.  He has been the butt of too many jokes.  Why?  Because he has been one of the few people with the balls to take these demons head on.  He has nothing to gain from it.  It has caused him nothing but heartache.  He does this for himself.  He does this for his beloved friend.  He is a good man.  Who do you suppose he will out?Please, please, please, please, don't be Speilberg.You can ixnay the "youtube movie" and put the money towards a kick-ass legal team, Corey.Blackfish single handily destroyed Seaworld's breeding program.  If a documentary takes off, changes happen.To put the nail in the coffin on this, we need top-down enforcement. We need names like Barrymore, NOT YOU, DiCaprio, Depp, Pitt, Jolie, Johansson, etc.. to basically get on board and say "if you did anything, you're out, if you *see* something and you don't speak up, you're out." Professionally and socially, they need to exile these fuckers. A lot of big players are former child stars, or at least teenage heartthrobs. Even if they weren't abused, they likely had more than their share of unwanted propositions from people who could make things happen for them. They might not be the ones pulling the multi-billion dollar purse-strings, but you get blackballed from working on any projects involving 90% of the biggest names in Hollywood, you're finished. As stupid as it might sound, a big film is just the vehicle to get a lot of attention in those circles. They're movie stars, they love movies. They also love a good crusade, especially a highly publicized one. They also want to be on the ground floor of everything. I mean who wants to miss out on being one of the pioneers who stopped institutionalized child sexual abuse in Hollywood? This thing hits critical mass, and the whole fucking city will be on board. They need a culture shift. They need to be more afraid of staying silent than they are of speaking up. Lawsuits don't change cultures. People watch movies.  It's a decent medium for spreading awareness.  Look what "An Inconvenient Truth" did.   It's a much better idea than some behind-closed-doors legal battle, 30+ years after the fact. Go Corey go!  Crucify these scumbags! Saw this coming after the lid blew off of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Something as picture perfect as Hollywood has to have some sizable dark secrets.Good luck and godspeed, Corey.
&gt; The College of the Ozarks has unveiled a military science class called Patriotic Education and Fitness. The course aims to educate students on modern military customs, U.S. politics and flag protocol. It will also teach rifle marksmanship, map reading and rope knotting.Sounds an awful lot like paying private-college-credit prices for skills they teach for free in the boy scouts.Honestly, the most patriotic thing they can teach is how the government works. How bills pass, how legislature works, what all the departments and committees are and what they do, how elections work and how you can participate in them.Anything else is just useless fluff.OMG, a sensible comment! My only question is, should the emphasis be on how it *should* work, or how it *actually* works. &gt; and how you can participate in them.This is the most important thing. I'm amazed at the difference between some of the states and communities I've lived in. Some have a high degree of public participation. Others, it's near zero. It's my unscientific observation that the states with the higher level of public participation are generally happier communities. Although you hear a lot of complaining and raised voices in such communities, once the meeting is over, everybody gets along fine. In the communities where there's little public participation, there's a feeling that something is simmering below the surface, and "better just keep your mouth shut, and avoid eye contact". &gt;and "better just keep your mouth shut, and avoid eye contact".Adopting the Minnesotan way of life. They use this approach with everything. Though we do have a higher than normal participation, the more rural communities give you a sense of the wide range of political leanings....They need to bring back that cartoon character of a Bill, who sings about how bills are made.I think it would be even more patriotic to teach critical thinking skills, logic, empathy, and community service.I wish there was an adult "manscouts" that taught this stuff. I wouldn't mind going camping and shooting guns with a bunch of other new friends.I gotta figure you start to get dangerously close to joining weird local militias to get that kind of training. Join a boy scout troop as an adult, angle to become a leader, learn with the kids, maybe? Just, yknow, don't also try and diddle any of them. Man I wish it were that easy.  When I was in scouts we had two great adults helping lead.  The one day a group of the parents started in with something approaching accusatory questioning: "You don't have your own kids in scouts, yet you volunteer?  Why do you want to be around kids?"  They noped the fuck out at that point and I don't blame them.  Or just hang out at your local gun range and people will inevitably join you.&gt; I wish there was an adult "manscouts" that taught this stuff.The military? If you or anyone else reading this lives in Oregon, pm me. One of my favorite things to do is to take people who have little to no firearms experience and teach them everything that I know.Includes basic firearm safety, the cycle of firearm function, firearms malfunctions, basic marksmanship, combat shooting, urban combat and familiarization fire with pistol, rifle, shotgun. I will also help you shop for a firearm if you decide you want to buy one and will help you locate the best prices on ammunition and holsters and accessories.  I have taught several people how to shoot that had been previously scared of firearms and had literally never held one before.This experience come with the added benefit of not being riddled with political commentary that you may or may not agree with. If you do want to learn about firearms but don't live in the same area I do, check out this map from Operation Blazing Sword.https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1N0_r7Irlhyi94t7IHxhC_jmysFE&amp;ll=43.96043663739227%2C-121.47516584594723&amp;z=8I also love camping and hiking with my puppers (and the wife), I love survival and bushcraft, I know First Aid and CPR, and I am an advocate of being prepared for natural disasters and other things. I can also help you put together wilderness survival kits, "bug-out bags", and emergency supplies. Flag protocol, rifle marksmanship, maps reading, and rope knotting.  Seriously all badges I had.  Hell, the content of the class may not even be that bad, but the name raises a HUGE red flag, and I cannot speak to how it is/will be taught.My jrotc class did all of this. Under the supervision of 3-4 retired military folks It's a tiny Christian college with a long track record of anti-LGBT bigotry and religious batshittery. This "patriotism" class is just the cherry on top of the indoctrination sundae.Otherwise, it looks like just another bullshit course. It's the bible thumper's equivalent of paying thousands of dollars to take billiards on Friday.Why is that a red flag...? Its called Patriotic Education and aims to educate students on modern military customs, U.S. politics and flag protocol. If just called it military sciences 101 you would be fine, but add the politics, then there is a private college angle. It doesn't sound bad at first but Patriotic Education, sounds too close to political indoctrination. The marksmanship part sounds fun though.Interestingly, the school charges no tuition to full time students. So at least they've got that going for them.&gt; Sounds an awful lot like paying private-college-credit prices for skills they teach for free in the boy scouts.Not unlike paying insane tuition at public universities to study nonsense that can be learned with a library card. There's no difference.Where did you go that BSA was free?I lived in the middle of nowhere and it was 20 years ago so it's entirely possible that other folks' mileage varied.or high school civics.Civics used to be part of the curriculum of any school. It was taken for granted that you had to learn about your rights and obligations as a citizen. I had civics classes beginning in elementary school, my sister, who's five years younger, wasn't taught it until high school, now it's not required in many states.Home economics has disappeared as well, and yet we're all surprised when people don't know how to budget money and balance a checkbook.home economics (late 90s early 2000s) was just cooking and sewing.  I don't remember anything about personal finance, but I agree that it should be something taught in high school.Wasn't that different in the 80s-90s (class of 1995), I took two different home economics classes, one was sewing and stuff like that, the other was cooking.  That was like 7th-8th grade.  We were briefly introduced to writing checks in 6th grade when we went on a field trip to a place called Exchange City, but we each got a job for the day in a mock city, had to write checks, get a paycheck, spend it wisely, etc (I was a police officer and got to write tickets).Other than that, no checkbook education.  Writing checks and balancing checkbooks is simple, doesn't need a whole course.  Especially now, when only elderly people in front of you at the grocery store (slowly) write checks (and can't even remember what store they are in).Briefly thought we might have grown up in the same town from your story but did a quick search first, TIL exchange city is a national organization and not just a quirky building in central Indiana In my school, Home Economics included budgeting/checkbook, it wasn't the entire course. We were also taught basic cooking skills, sewing, cleaning, basic first aid, and nutrition.My school taught all of this stuff, but it was considered a burnout class for stoners and pregnant girls.If you actually stood a shot of going to college you wouldn't have been caught dead near that class, and you gave up your lunch to fit in AP Biology.I grew up in the projects of Brooklyn in the 1970s and for all of the problems going on, stoners and pregnant girls were virtually nonexistent. The notion of an unmarried girl getting pregnant was still something to be avoided. There weren't stoners for years yet, they were just drug addicts at that point and you didn't have them in fifth grade.These were core classes to learn life skills, they were required in elementary school. AP Biology is high school, this was taught right from the beginning.There should just be a life skills class.  Budgeting, first aid, and I am sure a whole bunch of other shit thrown in there too.  There was home ec, and Health class, but so much more could be covered. Home Economic was a life skills class, the original definition of economics is "of or relating to a household or its management."It included all those things. There were also required classes in basic household stuff and repairs. Part of your schooling was how to function as an adult, to be handy and to be frugal; these were courses designed partially in response to the Great Depression.I would also argue that it's not academic, it's a "how to be a human" skill, which is traditionally taught by parents.Means you need to have involved parents.My high school had a personal finance class, although it was not mandatory. This was a few years ago.Personal finance and budgeting etc classes should be mandatory to graduate high school There needs to be a lifeskills class taught in high school that goes over basic stuff you should know if you decide to live without a parent or guardian.  Things like how to cook, home repairs, car repairs, personal finance, taxes, job search and interviews, sex, relationships, social skills, how to take care of a baby and raise a kid, etc.  Right now, you learn as you go with these things.  High school econ and health classes taught the bare minimum; nothing more than "supply and demand" terminology for econ and shitty videos for health.  There’s also YouTube for this stuffThat would work if you had time to watch this stuff, but some things you need to know ASAP as they come up, such as how to shut off your water line if a pipe bursts or CPR.This isn’t civics- it’s propaganda.By teaching people how to do marksmanship??I'd be willing to bet it comes with a lot of "Muh Tree of Liberty" talk.&gt;balance a checkbookI haven't written a check in 3 years, there is both third party and bank provided software for doing if you do need to balance it. &gt;if you do need to balance it.If you had had Home Economics you'd understand what balancing a check book actually means.I have not seen anyone balance a checkbook in literal *decades.* My grandma has even made the conversion to digital.I'm not talking about the basic math of it, we had arithmetic and calculators back in the old days. Balancing your check involved keeping track of your spending habits, your recurring bills, making sure you could cover emergency expenses. Did you have enough saved for yearly events like life insurance payments and Christmas presents?You paid with cash or check, credit cards were still a rarity. The banks closed early, and you didn't have ATMs everywhere until the mid-to-late 1980s. Knowing how much you had and how much you had access to was important, it wasn't simply subtracting a check from your total and calculating the difference.&gt; Balancing your check involved keeping track of your spending habits, your recurring bills, making sure you could cover emergency expenses. Did you have enough saved for yearly events like life insurance payments and Christmas presents?No, all of that stuff is budgeting. Balancing the checkbook is just accounting for checks written/deposits made, which isn't a super necessary thing these days.Uhhhh no.  That's budgeting.  "Balancing a checkbook" is just keeping tabs on check transactions so that you know how much cash you have available and can call the bank out on any discrepancies. Budget =/= balancing a checkbook.Let's have a fight to the death over semantics. It used to be budgeting was called balancing a checkbook. All your money was deposited into your checking account, all your money came out of your checking account. Because we didn't have computers there were no online records, you couldn't check your balance or pay a bill using a nonexistent cellphone. Everything was in your checkbook, that was the record of your economic life.I can see every transaction I make right this second. I'm logged into my online account for my bank (usaa). Not only can I see what I spent but I can categorize it. Gtfo with your checkbooks the only check I or anyone I've known for the last decade writes is for rent They don't mean a literal checkbook, they're referring to Budgeting. Usually, when balancing a checkbook is taught budgeting is also somewhat taught.So when you say balance a checkbook, what you mean is you're going to go through your bank statement, match it up with receipts to check against fraud or double charges, and ensure that your outgoing expenses do not exceed your income and savings needs.Just because you can see the ledger at a moment in time doesn't mean you have the ability to predict what it's going to be next month.  Not many people in the US have this skill, 2/3 of them don't even have more than 500 dollars in savings to their name.&gt; Home economics has disappeared as well, and yet we're all surprised when people don't know how to budget money and balance a checkbook.I wonder if there's some correlation between this going away and personal debt rising.&gt;I wonder if there's some correlation between this going away and personal debt rising.I would guess there's a stronger correlation between personal debt and stagnant wages combined with increased costs. Most people simply can't get everything they "need" with what you make in your teens and twenties, so they acquire credit cards and loans. When you start knowing how to balance a checkbook and checking against your budgets, you start noticing where the government is taking it away and later, where they are spending it and how much others are or are not paying in taxes....Which makes you an educated citizen... which they may not want.They still teach both of thoseThe United States has thousands of school districts and private schools have their own curricula. It would be interesting to see which % of school districts have substantial civics education.This isn’t even a civics class. Civics is not equal to patriotism &gt; people don't know how to budget money and balance a checkbook.This is bullshit...https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/14/millennials-are-more-financially-responsible-than-boomers-or-gen-x.htmlhttps://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2017/0221/Why-Millennials-are-better-with-their-money-than-their-parentshttp://time.com/money/4824916/millennials-baby-boomers-saving-money-emergency/https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewjosuweit/2017/08/25/4-surprising-ways-millennials-are-managing-their-money-better-than-boomers/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/It's low hanging fruit that millennials are bad with money.  It's a way to shift away from other issues and come up with reasons why millennials aren't moving out, getting married, having families, etc as quickly as past generations.Cost for damn near everything has risen.  From a gallon of milk to college to the cost of a started home.  Everything is much more expensive and unfortunately pay has not risen for many industries to keep up with prices.Plus a lot of industries that people were able to get into without a college degree and still make a middle class living have disappeared.So now there are more people living at home later, more people getting married later, more people not buying a home or getting a home much later.  It's not because we're irresponsible with money, it's because things just cost so damn much.I'm an older millennial (turning 31 in a few weeks).  I make over 90k and live with my fiancee so we're well into $100k+ for a combined household income.  Buying a decent sized home that isn't 90+ mins away from work, in a safe area, and near decent schools in Chicago means spending 400k+ when in decades past it was significantly cheaper.   It's not in the Banks interest to have people educated about how to balance a checkbook.  And they own the politicians, etc so don't expect to see a lot of Personal Finances classes out there in high school.Sound like a fun class to be honestI don't see why this is news. Private schools have all types of requirements and rules that aren't found in the public sector.Yeah my school had a religion requirement. It didn't have to be Christianity, the idea I guess was to make you more aware of religious diversity around you. Based on a lot of comments on reddit about Muslims, I think much of reddit could have benefited from that class. Studying religion academically is pretty hugely different from studying it in a religious context, though.I only attended one catholic school for a couple years but religious studies were taught "academically" without any "catholic context" applied to any of the material. Because it's disturbing. By branding their own belief system as "patriotism" they are implying that anyone who doesn't adhere to this is unpatriotic. That's in total opposition to the American ideal. Our country was born of the freedom to believe differently than your neighbors and to disagree with leadership. &gt;The college announced last month that its teams won't compete against other teams whose players don't stand for the anthem.Aw look, just another instance of the gigantic crybaby snowflakes on the RIGHT needing their safe space. kneel and get a free win.  I know what I'm doing if I'm an opposing coachYeah. In a lot of ways the over-reaction about kneeling for the flag is like the story of the upside down cross.The upside down cross didn't used to mean anything. Until some Christians hundreds of years ago started to over-react to it and treat it as a symbol of Satan or the Anti-Christ. Then some non-Christian groups started to use the upside down cross as their symbol just to piss those Christians off that they never liked in the first place.You're at least half right. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Saint_PeterActually, the upside down cross didn't mean anything anti-christian until Hollywood got hold of it. The 1964 film *The Masque of the Red Death* is the first I know to use it that way. Previously it was always a symbol for Saint Peter. The fact that many Christians actually buy it as a satanic symbol just kinda proves how much of people's faith is based in popular culture.I think it's more that the various sects popular in American tend to de-emphasize saints.  If you asked a Catholic they'd probably be able to identify the imagery much more readily than, say, a southern baptist.The hilarious part is that they don’t even have a football team.&gt;The College of Ozarks, a private, Christian liberal arts college with an enrollment of about 1,500, doesn’t have a football team. football players aren't the only athletes capable of kneelingOf course.My point was that these snowflakes were so triggered by something being done by professional football players that they created a rule to address a problem they weren’t having.The fact that they don’t even have a football team makes it even funnier!This is nothing but virtue signaling.&gt;Davis said there have been no anthem-protest issues with school teams, and he wants to keep it that way.&gt;The pledge is a response to protests that started in 2016, with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The anthem protests have picked up momentum this season in several forms.Football programs are large and expensive. I'd be surprised if a college this small had one.But yeah, this reeks of bullshit and political grandstanding. Typical conservatives.Yeah, not at all like those 'TEACH MEN NOT TO RAPE' classes that reddit loved in the early 2010s...Obviously, it's only conservatives who pull this nonsense.TRIGGERED BY OTHER'S ACTIONS THAT HAVE NO REAL WORLD EFFECT ON ANYONE ELSE!But yelling in someone's face about religion, abortion, or "the gays" is perfectly acceptable. &gt; Aw look, just another instance of the gigantic crybaby snowflakes on the RIGHT needing their safe space.So if both left and right want their safe spaces, is the desire for safe spaces fit for mockery, or does it reflect a universal desire to not being around people you disagree with (which is understandable but a trifle ominous for public life)?I think it's dumb either way but I like pointing out the hypocrisy of the right, who constantly bitch and moan about the entitled snowflake millennial liberals while acting just like the things they complain about.But now you're bitching about their safe supposed spaces.I wouldn't say I'm bitching, I'm just pointing something out.&gt;So if both left and right want their safe spaces, is the desire for safe spaces fit for mockery,Yes. It’s a stupid idea no matter which side does it.The reason conservatives are getting mocked so hard for their safe spaces is because they went out of their way to imply that only liberals used and wanted safe spaces.Do you guys even know what these terms mean anymore?It's private right? Then who cares, if they do disagree then they can go to another private school or go to a public school.There's nothing illegal about what they're doing, but we can still point out how ridiculous they are.Are you saying it is ridiculous to be patriotic? Or something else?No, the concept of a *mandatory patriotism* class is just a bit spooky. Patriotism, by definition, shouldn't be mandatory.Why can you people never understand the difference between criticizing things masquerading as patriotism and criticizing patriotism itself?If you think patriotism in America is flag and military fetishism you are literally the problem. No, I'm saying it's silly for there to be a "patriotism class" at a university.Mandatory class that involves learning how to "respect the flag" is ridiculous, yes.Oh for sure no doubtSure, it's totally legal and fine for a private institution to require courses on whatever they want. But it's at the very least creepy af and at very worst damaging nationalist propaganda to those students.It's a private college so I don't *really* care. But boy does "mandatory patriotism class" really really read as "indoctrination class" or what? The whole thing sounds like some piss take out of /r/ANormalDayInAmerica If I may:  The Collge of the Ozarks is an evangelical shithole who gives utterly worthless degrees in everything but nursing, and even then you're not going to get a job outside Missouri with it.  So these students are already completely screwed in life anyhow.  I can't see how this makes it any worse.I mean you have the exact opposite indoctrination at many universities so it's hard to judge too harshly. Honest question, what do you interpret as "exact opposite indoctrination?"You didn't have SorosBucks 101?[not taking a side-please don't downvote] California State Universities are doing a week long walkout this week because the Chancellor is trying to make it so students no long are required to take two "cross cultural studies" classes to graduate.Currently everyone (Engineering majors, Biology majors) need to take 2 courses in African American studies, Asian American Studies or Latino studies.Pro: students become more well rounded and better peopleCon: nearly 50 percent of students entering the CSU system need either remedial English, remedial math, or both. Perhaps more effort could be focused on these skills.[not taking a side. Just explaining what that guy was talking about. Will link articles if you need]I think they mean classes like "sociology" or "native american studies" or even "History".All those classes are clearly anti-american. American is a perfect country and anyone that tells you otherwise is a lying socialist commie pinko scumbag.Yes and no, I went to public college. The mandatory American Pluralism credits could be earned through a number of classes. Straight up American history, but a few classes like Native Americans in film and African American studies, etc. The goal was to try and get a sense of America from multiple POVs, most of the professors I had didn't really show any political affiliation. Actually American history was taught in lecture and pretty dry, I dropped it for Native American Film, loved it, It introduced me Graham Greene.It’s always people with little or no experience in academia who peddle this type of claim. Most likely because they think universities are just bigger high schools/middle schools, where everything taught was objective: history class teaches you comfortable facts like dates and names; psychology teaches you comfortable facts about your brain that aren’t contested at all; political science teaches you comfortable parts of the legal system that are written in literal text and have no ambiguity. And that’s great for teenagers. But it’s not what college is supposed to be. At least not in the social sciences. It’s is supposed to be for the frontier of knowledge— the things we are NOT comfortable with. The things that are well beyond established facts. NEW arguments. NEW ideas. Some will stick. Some won’t. There is hardly an academic discipline that, when taught at the collegiate level, is totally objective. What makes an established academic/professor is that fact that they *do* have those opinions on their subject and the fact that they have successfully supported them in their professional capacity. So professors asserting new ideas isn’t “indoctrination.” It’s their job. It’s exposure of students to new ways of thinking. The political right has chosen to stake its claim on “tradition” and being comfortable with the things they have always believed. That’s just general conservatism. Great. But then, necessarily, they get to claim that *any* new idea is “indoctrination.” Because it departs from the norm. But that’s nonsense.  You can learn basic, uncontested facts from books at the library. College is for new ideas. If you don’t like it, don’t go. Plenty of schools have mandatory religious classes. Its a private school, if you don't like it don't go there. well its a private college, it's their right to set the curriculum. Nobody is forcing students to go there. If this were a public school that would be a different storyPrivate school, can do as they wish.Of course it's an Evangelical college. I went to one of these Evangelical colleges for a basketball tournament when I was in high school (Pensacola Christian College). It was like going to Saudi Arabia or something. Men and women literally have separate sidewalks. Despite being adults, they cannot hang out with a person of the opposite sex without a university chaperone being present. They aren't allowed to listen to secular music or watch secular movies. It's pretty nuts.Man, I almost went to Pensacola Christian College.  I grew up in a pretty religious home and did the Abeka video Schooling produced by Pensacola. They offered a pretty sweet deal to go there but I remember looking at the brochures and thinking it all just looked so fake.  I was also growing away from organised religions at that point which furthered my desire to not go there.  Every crazy thing I hear about places like this makes me more and more glad I went to a good old fashioned secular state school.The right always complains about "the nanny state" or "the babying of our generation" but I see nothing worse than a situation like that.Side note, I miss McGuire's.A nanny state controls everyone whether they want it or not. A school like this only imploses these rules on the people that wish to attend and do so knowing these rules.I'm not sure why you thought the comparison was valid or why you thought this small school was significant enough to use as an attack against conservatives.&gt; but I see nothing worse than a situation like thatA completely voluntary situation like that is exponentially more preferable than a mandatory government imposed one. There are something the government should be pushing, but shitty diversity trainings, usually based solely off of race and sex, is not one of them.For freedom, this class is mandatory. Because we don't know what words mean anymore.The cool thing about having thousands of colleges in this country is that you don't have to go to this one. Another cool thing is that private colleges can do whatever they want.Another cool thing is we can complain about them.I would tell you to think, but I'm sure as a Morty you are already at peak.How do you feel about requiring Christian theology classes at private colleges?Its private so I don't careI would wonder why I would be attending a private college that required mandatory Christian Theology classes.Relax, enrollment includes a bottle of brainwash.  Makes the hogwash more palatable.They're free to do so, but it is still worth mockery.Religious universities do require theology classes.  If you attend you fail. If you protest the class by not showing up then you pass.(Full disclosure - I'm a redditor, so of course I did not read the article) I'm going to go ahead and guess that your comment is the 180-degree polar opposite of the view of "patriotism" that will be presented in this class.Idiots often confuse patriotism with nationalism     &gt; Multiple left-leaning colleges create mandatory 'diversity' classes    &lt; It's private colleges, stop whining!    &gt; A right-leaning college creates mandatory 'patriotism' class    &lt; OMG, ALT-RIGHT SNOWFLAKES! SHUT IT DOWN!!Sad how predictable Reddit has become.While many "diversity trainings/classes" are dumb, the levels between those and a "patriotism" class are pretty wide.You forgot the, "IMO".   It is important to remember that what you like and do not like are subjective. The fact that you think the patriotism is worse than diversity training is your subjective opinion.America is 100% perfect vs. America is 100% evil?Because everything in this country needs to be on one side or the other.  Tribalism is going to kill us.Boy you sound like one of &lt;them&gt; and we don't take kindly to no &lt;them&gt; round these here partsSounds like a cross between mandatory ROTC and Boy Scout campWell that's deeply unsettling. But as long as it's a private school that doesn't get federal money I can't find fault with it.Private school. No issue here.[This](http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/education/2017/10/23/college-ozarks-now-mandates-military-science-course-freshmen/789395001/) is from a local news article and has more information about the curriculum.  Because that news site is terrible and makes you take a survey, so here is some of the text of the article.Terrence Dake, a retired general with the U.S. Marine Corps, said the course promotes patriotism, which is a pillar of the college. He is also chair of the college's Board of Trustees.  "It's certainly obvious in America today that patriotism needs to be emphasized and have a rebirth as we come together as a nation and a start is right here, at College of the Ozarks, with these young folks," he said.He said students will learn map reading, land navigation, rifle marksmanship, rope knotting, and rappelling.The course also covers American government and politics, modern military customs and courtesies, and flag protocol and procedures.Dake, who served as assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, said the course also makes exercise and physical condition a priority. Among other goals, students must be able to run a mile.  "If they will get their physical fitness under control, it will serve them in all the areas of their lives," he said.  Talan Saylor, a freshman from Illinois, said the course is building camaraderie among students, who enroll from all over the U.S.  "We all go through kind of the same thing so going through a patriotic class where we are learning about our country and fostering a love for that country together is really special," he said. "It helps us bond."Saylor, 18, enlisted in the Missouri National Guard and plans to serve in the U.S. Army before he returns home to farm. He said the course teaches students about military lingo and how to pay respect to military officers.  He said not all students start the course with the same level of fitness but they help each other during training sessions.  "There have been a lot more people who will drop back and try and help those who fall behind and maybe they're beating themselves up," he said. "The people who finish first are encouraged to go back and encourage others." I also feel like I need to remind people this is a *private* *Christian* school.  This is not a public school curriculum.  The College of the Ozarks is an unusual college.  While it's explicitly evangelical Christian--"The College’s academic program is intentionally Christ-centered..."--it operates on a work study model which allows students to graduate debt free.My college tried adapting this approach shortly after they hired a new president from Pennsylvania, who promoted it but had no knowledge of area. The president bailed last summer when it became apparent that the model doesn't work so well in economically depressed regions, like the Wisconsin lakeshore, specifically Sheboygan and everything north of it. They had their 10 year review for accreditation, are running in the red for the first time ever and the Franciscan penguins who managed and taught at the college in the past have taken a step back. Between this, forced departures, a lack of staff with anything above a masters and the whole Blacks making 15% of the dorms but less than 0.5% of each graduating class, I'm thinking it's screwed. Funny how redditors who have repeatedly defended 'Teach Men Not to Rape' classes in public colleges, have defended mandatory 'cultural studies' programs at public California universities, somehow find this to be completely unacceptable.I had a professor who graduated from there.  He was one of the best gen-ed lecturers I ever had.  He lived to teach those auditorium courses and hated the publish or perish aspect.  This is neither here nor there in regards to the article.Can't exactly say this is any worse than public universities forcing you to take mandatory social "science" classes. Considering math is racist, white privilege is on full display at every college that demands students take math.They're making it **mandatory** to learn how to show "respect" for certain ~~idols~~ cultural/national symbols?  What could go wrong?[If only there was some biblical tale of woe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach,_Meshach,_and_Abednego) could serve as a lesson on why this is a bad idea for this evangelical/faith based institution to use a reference...EDIT:  hyperlink&gt;privateso if you disagree with it and it's not illegal, then move along.So what, it's a private college. If you go there you agree to drink their kool-aid. WTF does rope knotting have to do with Patriotism?  They couldn't find any textbooks that fit their need so they bought a bunch of used Boy Scout Handbooks?&gt;The College of the Ozarks has unveiled a military science class called Patriotic Education and Fitness. The course aims to educate students on modern military customs, U.S. politics and flag protocol. It will also teach rifle marksmanship, map reading and rope knotting.That sounds kind of fun to me, personally, but definitely not something that will appeal to the masses. Can't expect much different from private Christian colleges, most make you take a chapel type class for a couple years too.I personally would say it should be a high school class and not a college class.   Map reading/knot tying isn’t exactly what I would consider college level material.So what?True Patriotism is when you love your country ALL the time and your government when they deserve it. It's a private college. They can create whatever stupid fuckin classes they want. Patriotism isn't a crime, so legal adults paying to be in the same room together can teach and learn whatever they want to teach and learn.Maybe in that class they can study the Supreme Court case: West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette 319 U.S. 624 (1943)&gt;"To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous, instead of a compulsory routine, is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds."To be fair a private religious school, particularly an Evangelical one, isn't really concerned about being an "institution to free minds". They only require obedience.Why would they need to do that? They're a private college who isn't subject to this or any other constitutional provisions they don't have to, just thought maybe it would be nice if they did, since it is a great read about patiotism.&gt;An evangelical Christian collegeIs anyone surprised after reading the first four words of this article?Many of you are talking Civics, large difference between Civics and a mandatory Patriotism class. Civics? What's happening to this country? Next it will be Rhetoric! Stop it now!Civics isn't a class on patriotism.It sounds like stuff I learned in basic training. It really isn't difficult enough to be a college course.Basic training counts for college credit nowadays if you fill out the right paperwork.  I think I got like 6 credits from Basic/AIt that I was able to apply towards my electives.If I had gone for a criminal justice degree I would have only had to take the core classes for the first 2 years. CID school basically gave me all the credits I needed. Too bad I couldn't handle the cases with kids being victims and chose computer science Take this from a bleeding heart NY liberal, I think the curriculum should have a thing or two from military basic training. Along with basic understanding of the constitution and basic gun safety. Even if you are anti gun, everyone should know how to handle them. Plus some basic physical fitness would help healthcare cost down the line.  It being difficult is not the concern, friend.I think you're missing the point friendIt's a private Christian college? Don't go if you are upset by this? My sister went to a college that made them go to church every few days or something like that. I don't think she was wild about it but that's what she signed up for. I wish the state made it mandatory for state colleges as well!Mandatory patriotism isn't patriotism, it's indoctrination. And remember, service grants citizenship!Do you want to know more?Being the only college in the entirety of the United States, this is triggering me as I can in no way, shape or form avoid attending this private college in Missouri. there’s nothing wrong with loving your countryNothing to see here, just an Evangelical College trying to make a quick buck. Hell I'd take it. It also includes lessons on marksmanship, map reading and rope knotting. Heck yeah.That sounds like fun actually. Plus it's a private college so I don't really see the problem.♫Trumpland, Trumpland Über Alles..♫No worse than colleges having mandatory classes that speak about white privilege.Those are shit too.  Pfff yeah and I bet after piloting that for a year they’ll hand out the mandatory armbands.Mandatory patriotism is a thing for Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and North Korea. Not a place like the US. Idiots.TRUE FREEDOM is not giving private schools the right to teach what they want to teach.  DIVERSITY CAMPS AND MANDATORY CRITICAL THEORY CLASSES IN ALL SCHOOLS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LAND.true freedom means being ale to criticize something You are literal using 'true freedom' to try and not let someone criticizes something.   And so it begins, the destruction of democracy.   Theorcrats / Dominionism .     Go into detail how what a private entity does is a destruction to democracy At a private college?It is within the right of the private college to make a class like that mandatory. Do I think it’s necessary? No. But it’s no different than a private liberal arts school making gender studies a requirement.I wonder if this is how Nazism came to dominate the German society. Surely it wasn't an overnight thing. And it took years and decades to turn average German citizen into monsters. Will this post be referenced when they write about this after 80 years promising never again?  This is scary as fuck.The Nazi party only ever controlled around 35% of the seats in parliament. It was enough to make them the biggest party in Germany, but not the majority.What let them 'dominate' was a poorly written emergency clause, that let the person in Hitler's elected position assume absolute power in an emergency, including the power to completely rewrite the constitution and make themselves the permanent dictator.If you can have mandatory classes on identity politics and “critical race theory”, I”m fine with mandatory classes on patriotism.Where is critical race theory mandatory?Nowhere lmao.In his world of make believe. Where all the "leftists" are transsexual Muslims out to force everyone to gay marry.I had to take a mandatory class about "diversity" in my liberal arts college, that was pretty much entirely about critical theory, feminism, and identity politics. I was not fond of it, but it was pretty much a blow off class. Most people didn't take it particularly seriously. Mandatory patriotism is an oxymoron. Forcing someone to follow your idea of “patriotism” is called fascism.I didn't take a single course you mentioned for my computer science degree. It's almost like they're only required in specific majors that individuals are free to take or notNo college has MANDATORY classes on identity politics and race theory. Those are parts of CHOSEN majors.Is patriotism synonymous with propaganda these days?fantastic, this will make a lot of angry comments. brb grabbing a cup of coffee.Cool litmus test. What’s next mandatory church on Sunday?NFL wouldn't allow that 
Nothing compares to $3,000 a month for a studio apartment!im in the midwest,  but its getting outrageous here. everything popping up are luxury places, or are being made into luxury places. Don't worry, it'll all come crashing down on the developers when nobody wants to move to your area because the only thing drawing young people there (low prices) is gone. For some reason developers think that there is this unlimited supply of yuppies that will just keep on coming. Those luxury places are going to be slummy lofts in a decade or two. They don't care. They'll make as much as possible up front then ditch the property when it's not profitable any more.Eh, I'm already seeing it happen in my city. Massive luxury loft buildings going up by the literal dozen, my city is basically all cranes. But, these buildings stand empty. It's only a matter of time before property management companies want to stop being burned. What city is that? I kind of want to move into a cheap high rise. I was thinking maybe Atlantic City.They're not so much high rises as like, big ugly, box apartments &lt;10 stories. The city is [Denver](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.7507505,-104.9825357,3a,75y,95.75h,87.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slC46n__k16PGvNIgg8gxMg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) and here's another [example](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.7569484,-105.0001815,3a,75y,217.31h,106.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5gNDRIk6ri4Cr-JfJUo_qQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)I currently live in Denver and make a pretty good salary but still can't afford a house here.  I have a good deal right now on rent but have a roommate which sucks.  My end game right now is bank what I can and look into if my job will let me work 100% remote in about a year, and then possibly head to Minneapolis.  Same, but luckily my roommate is my girlfriend, so we're able to get away with a 1 bedroom. But yeah, hopefully more and more jobs being able to be done remotely (or things like a frontrange hyperloop making commutes painless and stupidly quick) will make cities decentralized a bit since people can live wherever they want. If you want to live in the city for the atmosphere you can, but you can also live in the middle of nowhere mountains and still "work" downtown. Don’t hold out hope for those remote-working dreams.  Hyperloop is not likely to be a thing until proven otherwise.  Also, remote workers always make less since they aren’t seen and get less raise or promotion opportunities.&gt; e before property management companies want to stop being burned.Foreign money will sustain the artificially inflated price in Denver for the forseeable future. It ain't slowing down soon. Probably, but that doesn't mean things won't stand empty until they are too big of a burden and the property is sold to be redeveloped but it's not worth it. I'm talking decades timeline, not years. It's happened over and over in every city in the country. Capitol Hill used to be where rich people lived, and as recently as like, 2012/13 it was sketchy and cheap. But, it's now on the upswing again.  When we were coming of age, mid to late 90's, Capitol Hill was someplace you lived if you liked doing drugs with creepazoids.I live in Atlanta and they look exactly the same. I can’t afford one of those so I commute an hour or more. Pretty standard for Atlanta.I just live in the attic of an old house in what used to be the rich folk area of town.That's how crashes occur though. Ditch it to *[who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory)*?They probably just sell it at a loss or no profit and move on.  Then who's going to buy them?I have a good suspection that foreingers will buy them out.the ones next to me are happy with 50% occupied rate.They are selling them to Chinese investors, they don't care if anyone actually lives in them.This. They are buying everything in my neighborhood in LA. In some cases they are buying several properties in a row like it's Monopoly. Then turning around and charging asinine rental rates.I have friends with high paying, prestigous jobs who have 50-100k to put down but getting outbid everywhere (including semi sketchy areas of town) by Chinese investors paying cash.It’s like this in London. Council houses sold off cheap to developers which are sold and advertised in Hong Kong to investors. Yet many can be left unrented. Sounds like another bubble which might hit China bad which won’t be good for anyone. It’s like we’ve learnt nothing from the old crash. Depends on the city, but yeahSeriously, I can stash 20 million here and pay you a pittance in taxes?  Where is the dotted line?This. My parents live in an upscale suburb of a west coast city. A couple months ago they got a flier in the mail from a Chinese couple asking if they were interested in selling their house. Not because it was on the market or anything -- everyone in the neighborhood got one. Given that the largest rise in billionaires is in Asia, this doesn't surprise me but it does piss me off because it's happening in low and middle income neighborhoods too. We should go the route of New Zealand and only allow citizens or permanent residents to buy homes here.The market  can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.If the crash of 2008 is any indication, the federal government is more likely to bail out large property owners than the middle class. In fact its pretty prone to abandon the middle class and help the property owners get their money back.You can also count the political class to be worthless, as the media has you running around more concerned about phantom pedophiles, school shooters, thugs, criminals, (((random buzzwords))) than the banks.So anytime you raise your voice, there is already an army of people who already believe that you are part of the conspiracy for doing so.damn dude, i want to say you're wrong but i don't think you are. Chinesse investors... They love emOne of the places I was looking into living in next year said that they’re going to phase out their standard units and only sell premium units. In the back of my mind I thought “what makes them premium if they’re the standard?” Then I realized: the cost is probably going to go way up, because they’re a national group and they can. Even the crappy apartment I live in has a $800 rent, and that’s on the low end.Minneapolis is like that.  Lived in a luxury place and looked at downgrading and realized shitty places were catching up in rent.  So I moved to Ohio and got a large raise and a 50% reduction in cost of living.  Tight.  No more stone arch bridge shots on the gram now though.  I just moved from a downtown studio apartment in Minneapolis to commute 20 minutes every day and despite the additional commute costs, it's still cheaper month to month than the $1800 studio apartment, so I feel you.In no way shape or form is Minneapolis a city that is worth spending 1800 to live in a studio.Oh I know, believe me.As if the rent wasn't enough, I missed being able to unload groceries from my car without the need for informing a valet that I'm just sitting my car there for a minute, using a skyway, or a parking garage.  I missed not having a siren every 2min (the fire precinct was nearby).  I missed not having obnoxious crowds of Vikings fans jaywalk in front of me while going 40MPH on a major one-way road, or being able to run to a drugstore to pick up cough drops without having to deal with a concert unloading its patrons into the streets after it's over.  I shouldn't have to pay $150 for an electric bill because it's normalized across all the units in the building and some jackass runs his AC all day.I really like it here, but man, what a rip-off.  Commuting is so much better.Hey you forgot about being asked for money or a cigarette every 15 feet.  Very cosmopolitan.Minneapolis is the type of city that you find a nice house on a lake in the suburbs to live in, and only go downtown for the nightlife or sports games.Downtown for sports.  Nightlife avoid it as cops stopped policing so crime is way up.Also midwestern, I see new apartments popping up almost every other day, and they’re insanely expensive. Also don’t see a ton of people moving into them. Can’t wait to see it crash and fail because rent is starting to get up thereNew construction is always luxury apartments because the majority of the buildout costs the same. You're already paying for the building, elevators, etc.  Adding granite countertops is a minor expense compared to the rest.  Edit:  Unless there is a tax credit for low income housing.only 3 floors around here. but yea, they plant the out side in dark flat greys and a white, and granite.. boom 300$ extra a month fuck, I live in a kansas city under 100k, but the luxury apartments keep getting openedNot just that but other rents in the city are going up. My rent went from $515 to $645 as of this month because new owners bought the building.  For new tenants they have rents listed at $900.  Keep in mind this is an older building and not some new luxury unit.  I feel like its either to quickly get their money back, renovations, weed out certain people, or because they're greedy/dicks. My apartment changed from normal apartments to luxury apartments two years ago. Want to know what they changed? The sign out front. It now says, "luxury apartments" and my rent went from 715 to 860 for a two bedroom apartment.They're "luxury" because the development is sold to investors and the apt/condos are sold as "high end investments". Nevermind what people who rent can afford. This is why the housing market is a bubble. Sounds normal in big city........[The rent is too damn high](https://youtu.be/79KzZ0YqLvo)But seriously, I feel for the kids starting out today.  It does seem like a kid graduating high school or junior college today has the deck stacked so hard against them that it seems almost hopeless.I just price checked the first apartment that I moved into just out of high school (I was 19).  2 bedroom and it was $400/mo. I was making $9-10/hr (tech support), and had to pay full rent the first two months until my roommate was ready to move in, then it was $200/mo for me. Just checked, and the same 2br apartments are going for $800/mo. I don't think wages have doubled the last 20 years, so yeah the options are a lot narrower for newer generations. I rented a 2 bedroom place in Lakewood, CO in 1997 for $500/mo, utilities included. That same shithole was listed for $1500/mo last year.I did the math, and moving an hour out of the city and buying a home is cheaper than renting in my area (north of Boston)Yes, using mobility to arbitrage the the Delta between Urban salary and suburban housing cost can be personally effective, and socially costly.  You can suffer the sadness of commuting for 500 hours a year to improve your personal life.  Socially though this comes at an immense energy cost, pollution, productivity, and causes Urban sprawl.  And I did this too.This is not an improvement over the situation of 30 years ago, and doesn't address the high cost of schools and healthcare which were much lower when us geezers were starting out.  Nor the fact that even using this method that the commute must be ever longer to get the same net Delta.I'm probably typing this from a few miles away. Reddit is creepy, but yeah it's absolutely fucked. To buy a condo anywhere within a half hour drive of work in boston you're looking at a mortgage of 2k/mo+ when you take into account HOA etc. It's lunacy.I feel a tinge of jealousy every time I see someone talking about moving out at 18-19 and doing it on their own ever since. I've had many luxuries afforded to me- parents paid for college, handed me a car for the first five years of my driving life, and helped me out with phone bills. I'm now 28 and still living with them because here in Southern California (border of LA and OC), I can't justify the rent prices. I make about 42k a year before taxes, and save about 2k a month, and the only debt I've ever had was the car I bought in 2012, which is now completely paid off.Even in my position, which is far more fortunate than other folks my age that have student loans and such, I just can't justify spending 1-1.5k a month on rent. Fuck it. No thanks. I'm saving, saving, occasionally buying a video game, and saving some more, and eventually buying a house way the fuck away from here.EDIT: What I should have said was that I'm jealous of folks who find a way to survive on their own at age 18, whether they're forced to or choose to, because there's no way I'd have been able to do it until my late 20's, and even then, I choose the safe route of staying home and saving because I'm afforded that privilege. Y'all got balls that embarrass many other millennials, myself included.  EDIT 2: u/emypeaches pointed out that I should have used something along the lines of 'respect' or 'admiration' rather than 'jealousy.' He/she's absolutely right. I apologize if this comment made me sound like an entitled shit that's jealous of those in harder situations than myself. It's definitely a respect and admiration that those folks were able to do something at an age that's increasingly difficult for other millennials to do it at.People that move out earlier not only dont get college paid for them or given cars, they dont have a choice in the matter, they are adults and have to go.Bingo. I wish I could have stayed at home for 2 more years and worked on my degree. But nope, 18 and out. Which, in 1997, was perfectly reasonable. If the same thing happened to me today in the same place (Denver area), fucking forget it, I'd be living in a refrigerator box.And you give your parents rent, right? Right? Excuse my poor math, but also living in CA I’m making around $50k a year before taxes. This leaves me with about $3k a month after taxes, medical, all that fun stuff.  OP is maybe taking home $2,500-2,700/month?There is no way to save $2k per month and pay rent at the same time. No way. His rent is just doing the chores around the house. Mom still does his laundry though. Not everyone operates under the same cultural normals. For me, it would have been odd to even consider paying rent when I lived with my parents. If their mortgage was a burden, of course I would have contributed as if it was my responsibility without question. But if some parents are ok financially, I don't see paying rent as some sort of noble action.&gt; Mom still does his laundry though.Also available for handies if he happens to break his arms.*sigh* every fuckin' threadYou're jealous of them? They're living hard knocks and most don't have the luxury of still living with mom and dad. Your parents are handing you the world on a silver platter. Saving $2k a month and you're complaining?Look, please do appreciate what you're parents are doing, but don't be jealous of other people. Get your priorities straight. People don't justify paying $1k-$1.5k a month on rent. They have no choice. And you're welcome to let go of the teat at anytime you like.oh wow I wish i had the luxury of living with my parents and NOT having to pay rent Its a very western way of thinking. To some, paying rent for the sake of it seems odd. If my parents had financial trouble, I would give my whole pay check to them. But if they are doing okay, from my cultural upbringing, paying them rent serves no purpose. I think a lot of it has to do with different perspectives on the individual vs the family.What you are thinking of is envy, not jealousy. Jealous means you are insecure because they are interested in what you have. Envy means you wish you had what they have. In this case, you are envious of their bravery in moving out and ability to survive on their own so young.Do you think there might be a connection between all those things your parents gave you and the fact that you're still living at home? They all indicate that his parents are willing and able to assist him/herThere is something inherently wrong with someone who has parents like this and is jealous of those who don't and have to make their own way. Nah, he's just jealous of their gumption and ability to forge a path by themselves. He's very aware how cushy his current situation is. I'm right in that boat with you. I spend around 1k/mo ( a little less) living outside the city. The city avg rent is 2200/1 bed. Sucks hard as a 24year old. getting along with your parents is another luxury. If you can save that much a month I don't think 1000 on rent is that crazy, but that's only if its something you want.You can live in that area on 42K a month on your own.1 k is less then a 1/3 of what you make. You're just a mooch.I know I can. I can't reasonably do it and SAVE, however, so I've chosen to mooch and save. Thank you for your well-considered analysis. &gt; I feel a tinge of jealousy every time I see someone talking about moving out at 18-19 and doing it on their own ever since.&gt;Even in my position, which is far more fortunate than other folks my age that have student loans and such, I just can't justify spending 1-1.5k a month on rent.  Fuck it. No thanks.   "You pay for rent and have been since you became an adult?  I'm so jealous!  I wish I could do that!  I'm stuck voluntarily living with my parents and saving money even though I can afford rent.  Ugh, some people just have all the luck." And the Democrats say everything is fine and dandy, and they wonder why Trump won.I’d add the core Republicans were ignoring things too.  Trump is a bit of an outlier for them.That’s why Trump won the primary, the voters didn’t want another milquetoast pencil pusher.Should've been Bernie.They clearly need to move somewhere more remote.Cheap houses in the country, but good jobs in the city.Catch 22C'mon out to East Tennessee!  3 bedroom house for $850 a month.  Nice 1 bedroom apartment for $500. Low unemployment, and wages run from $11/hour for call-center work, to $23/hr for office work.  Labor is tight enough that even a McJob runs around $9/hr.  No income tax. Nice weather, too.This is a good point that a lot of people overlook. There's literally thousands of miles of land in between SF and Manhattan that's often completely ignored.This land has plenty of medium and large cities and offer good paying jobs (especially if you're in the tech industry). I live in the 4th largest metropolitan area in the US and pay $530/month for rent. *I don't live in the middle of nowhere*. I live literally a 10 minute drive from one of the largest cities in Texas (and a sizable city by national standards as well). We have air conditioning (Texas summer isn't an issue), free/cheap parking, and traffic is nowhere close to as bad as SF, LA, or NYC.It's Texas, but the city and county that I live in is *solidly* blue. No, you won't find a bunch of racist shit-kickers here. You have to go *well* out of your way to find them.There are tons of high paying tech jobs here where you can make six figures. Not all tech jobs are in SF.It seems like few people on reddit ever consider this. It seems like a lot of people think you can only live in SF or NYC, and you're literally not allowed to live anywhere else. Tech jobs exist in Texas because Silicon Valley ran out of real estate. Meaning you'd have to be literally retarded to live and work in silicon valleySilicon Prairie existed before Silicon Valley ran out of real estate. Same here in Beantown.Yup. Though real estate here is crazy too. You can still find $500 or less rooms though. $500 if you're lucky. And if it's that price chances are better than good that it's for a cot in the corner of the living room with a jerry rigged curtain around it.Hey now, I have real walls, a roof that doesn't leak, and free parking. In the city proper. And walking distance to a "real" subway (that I don't use)... Though you're far more likely to end up on a couch for that amount. The median is probably like $850-1100 for a room &amp; share in Boston Proper (AB, Rox, Dot, JP, Eastie) or Cambridge/Everett/NQuincy/Brookline/Medford. &gt; racist shit-kickers hereI've lived all over the south, Texas included, and I've hardly ever encountered any racist people, they're much more rare than you think, and it really has nothing to do if you are red or blue. In fact, in my personal opinion I've encountered far more racist liberals who try to shame me for being white other than people who think that black people are less than human or w/e.Commenting on the Red/Blue aspect: regardless of what state you live in, if you live in an urban or suburban environment it's far more likely to be majority blue. Rural environments tend to be strongly red. Urbanization has a direct correlation with political leaning.  States that are becoming more urban like Texas, or intaking large numbers of people like Texas, are becoming increasingly blue. Texas, if it keeps going like it is, will be a blue state within 10 years. Back pre-1970 Texas was a blue state that every democrat had to win to get in office. From 1970 through now they've been Red.  That will be a major loss for the red base. And will force a paradigm shift in the political landscape. Ten years? I'd really doubt that. The urban growth is something for sure, and the exponentially growing Hispanic population is causing concern, but even in Austin there's a sizable conservative population.Perhaps in the coming decades we'll see some shifts, and the Texas Republican Party is going to have to work to maintain a a 35-40% Hispanic vote, but transplants in suburbs (as opposed to urban cores) are likely to shift to the right, and current young white Texans (and the children of white transplants) are likely to have conservative views. Basically, I really don't think Texas has a chance of going blue in a long time. Most theories of this rely on transplants and Hispanics showing up to vote blue with no change in Republican Party strategy, culture, or laws.People who think the south is filled with super racists and that only whites can be racist have usually never lived in the south or near minorities. Am minority, we have plenty of racists.Some Mexicans think we are superior than central Americans etc.We literally call salvadorians cerotes (big turd)Can confirm that the deep south is full of racist shit-kickers.  No idea what percentage, but definitely *far far far* from "rare".Source: Also grew up there, and family all still lives there.  The vast majority of them are racist shit-kickers, too.If you are a proud Southerner (nothing wrong with that) and you stand by the idea that racism is mostly "anti-white liberals", you're actually kidding yourself.I assume you're in Austin? Are you afraid of your city going the way of others? I don't have any data on hand, but I feel like I keep seeing anecdotal discussion about places like Portland and Austin starting to get more and more expensive as folks from the coasts flock to them.Once again, I have no data on hand, but wasn't Seattle super affordable just a decade ago, and is now as bad as Los Angeles? I'm personally planning to move from Los Angeles to either Southern Washington, Oregon, or Idaho in about two years.I'm in DFW. Austin is an anomaly in Texas. It's far more expensive than other cities because of the hipster/coolness factor. Everyone wants to live there because it's the city to be in, which increases prices.Cities like San Antonio and Houston are *dirt* cheap, and filled with high paying jobs if you're in the tech industry. And they're all liberal/progressive strongholds as well.I haven't heard of $530 rent in Dallas in years... unless you have a roommate. Efficiencies seem to start at $900. A 600 square foot condo in my complex usually rents for around  $1000. Where exactly do you live?In the ghetto. Forgive me for not giving out my exact address or even apartment complex. I've been here 2 years now and never personally had an issue with crime.If it's south of I-30 it doesn't exist on reddit. Austinite checking in. Austin is expensive relative to other Texas cities, but it's still vastly more affordable than LA, SF, or NYC. In my safe, centrally located neighborhood, a 2 bedroom/ 2 bath Craftsman will run you about $1600 - $2000 in rent. That's absolutely manageable for most young professionals, so long as you split the rent with someone. If you do, please don't bring your California political values with you. The rest of the west hates it when Californians bring their baggage with them, drive up house prices, and impose stupid gun laws. I don't tend to align politically with my own state, if it helps. I grew up around guns, and I generally think enjoying a beer on the beach with a dog is perfectly acceptable.Moved to Seattle 4 years ago and it was WAY cheaper than it is now. Currently looking to relocate because of it. Even 45 mins north of Seattle proper, and the surrounding metro area, is ridiculous. Hmm, what’s the catch?It's difficult for a lot of people to justify relocating hundreds or thousands of miles to work in an office or call center for $20 an hour...And they act like it's really feasible to live even in that area on $11/hour.  Sure, that works, until you get some medical expense, or god forbid a kid.You have to live in Tennessee.I charge about 15%-20% below market rate for my area because I would rather keep a tenant grateful than pissed. But I am sure ruthless about who gets in and If you pull crap on me it will go up fast as fuck.Yep, do anything you can to keep a reliable and happy tenant. My family rents out some buildings.  They're just happy when they get a tenant that pays the rent.  Not even necessarily on time...I generally charge 10-15% more than market rate. In LA there's always someone desperate to sign a lease above market value. The day a listing goes up the phone is ringing non-stop. My MIL's rent has gone up 50% in the last 2 years with no apparent improvement to anything.  It is still a literally-trashy apartment complex.I moved into an apartment building in 2013 at $1200 a month in Massachusetts. After 3 management companies the only thing that has changed is my rent is $1675 now. That's insane. What's funny is these tenants are the same people who negatively judge me for living in my car. Yet, I'm not living paycheck to paycheck like them, and actually have a savings now.are you a stealth camper with a van? How long do you plan on living in your car? What do you do with your time? I imagine sitting in a vehicle gets boring fast. How do you work/maintain personal hygiene? Why do you live in the car? I am very curious... I mean a girl will still come back to your shitty apartment. She’s not going to come back to your car I think this poster is a women, if she’s straight, I’m sure some dude would come back to her car, lol. My neighborhood has landlords buying a few new appliances for their literal crackhouses for rich kids to come live in for 4 times the price it was originally, then they get harrassed and have all their packages stolen, but everyone is fine with that apparently.Oakland? Though sadly it could be any number of citiesOr Portland/Seattle Chicago actually.I had to move away from Colorado because I was spending half my paycheck on a one bedroom apartment right on the edge of the crappy side of town.Real estate investors sure have made out like bandits on the 08 crash. And this is just a continuation of the 08 crash. &gt; And this is just a continuation of the 08 crash.Yup.  For the vast majority of the people there was no "recovery" and we've been living in a second Great Depression.  But hey, GDP is up and that's literally the only thing that matters so obviously the rest of everyone needs to just shut up and enjoy (/s).Make it hard to build by zoning and NIMBY laws/regulations and you get a lack of supply which push a rent higher at all levels. Don’t know why this is shocking to anyone. It's not just NIMBYism. A lot of property owners support these policies so they can jack up rent prices and make more money. Lack of supply increases prices?  No way!  /sLook at Irvine, CA - they're building almost 8,800 new units a year (at least as of late) and rents are still rising a couple hundred a month every renewal. I know in my area of the complex, there are 6 units that have been empty for a while and I never seem to keep a neighbor for more than a year and prices still rise. While I think some areas are due to lack of supply, it feels like there's other things at play. I say feel because I haven't researched it well enough to say one way or the other; they're obviously building all those units because they believe they can fill them, i.e., the demand is there, but with so many options and no one company dropping their prices, it seems like collusion.You can build as many condos you want, but if people are buying them up and banking them, then the supply hasn't really increased for people actually tying to live in them.I wouldn't doubt it.  We live in a crony capitalistic society.Might want to recheck your buzzword dictionary for something a little more applicable.It's a factor, but not a given.Also, increasing building costs with high permit and inspection fees, “historic” neighborhoods that cannot be renovated, costly building codes.  No, we do not need to retrofit old buildings with arc fault interrupters.  That costs a fortune.In my old college town, the neighborhood where I lived was all old Victorian's that had been cut up into tiny apartments. It was a great neighborhood. Lots of good parties, and close to everything.Now they are tearing those houses down a block at a time and putting up luxury student condos. Developers are actively tearing down a historic neighborhood (The house I lived in for most of college was built in 1888), and putting up overpriced apartments made of ticky-tacky and raising rent for everyone in the process. I suspect that each block of apartments that goes up represents more housing units, but they are priced way above what was there before.All of what has been mentioned is true but one thing that is overlooked is that the units are being rented out by multiple people with an income source. It’s the only way to afford these units but at the same time it’s contributing to the high rents.To be fair even if they built new housing it would just be more luxury condos sold to foreigners and left empty since they just function  like gold bars**Housing is complicated now that it is just a gold bar**Quick example I ran into where I build in Chicago. We purchased two properties next to each other in a nice neighborhood and wanted to rezone so we could build a small condo building instead of two single family homes. The rezone would have added one more floor so we could do three units on each property with a shared access stairwell. The neighbors went nuts saying they would lose their views (they didn't have any) it would be too big (?) Etc. The alderman sided with them and that was that. So instead of building condos that would have been in the realm of possibility of some buyers we were forced to build $1.5m single family homes only the truly rich can afford. If I was a neighbor in that 'hood I'd go nuts too. The zoning guy made the right call. Putting condos in just to net one more family in the area while driving down the value of the surrounding houses ain't worth it, except to you maybe. Seriously. I live just outside the city limits of Chicago, and if one more family moves onto my block, there's going to be a fucking parking war lol.If someone gets to build then it's just all luxury apartments/condos.  It's all wannabe Trumps trying to upsell shit to people with money.  I haven't seen a single housing development in my city in the last 10 years that wasn't targeted at people making close to 6 figures.And you can try to make laws like 80/20 for subsidized housing but that just helps the super broke someone that just can't afford the apartment can't qualify for that.I think you raised some interesting points. “If someone gets to build” implies that it is difficult for people to secure the building permits they need to build housing. In that case, why wouldn’t someone build a project with a much higher ROI?  If it costs me, say, 200K to get the permits and the approvals I need, I can recoup those costs much easier across 50 500K houses than I can across 75 $200K houses. So which would you build?Additionally, if more units are built at any pricing level, that does help drive down (or at least moderately pressure) housing costs across the entire market.  The problem we have is that housing starts are not keeping up with housing demand in certain markets which is what is driving up the costs. East coast* here, relocated out of NYC now. I tried to look into affordable housing when I was struggling in the city (after being pushed out further and further by rising rents), the lists are so long you better forget it. They have a lottery too... very fat chance.&gt;[There are now 227,000 individuals and families on the waiting list for Housing Authority apartments, totaling roughly half a million people, and the queue moves slowly. The apartments are so coveted that few leave them. Only 5,400 to 5,800 open up annually.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/nyregion/for-many-seeking-public-housing-the-wait-can-be-endless.html)I get that NYC is expensive to live in and everyone wants to be there, but it's becoming nearly impossible for anyone but the extremely wealthy or a ton of people packed together. It's always been difficult, but it seems to be nearing impossible. I won't get started on the slumlords or illegal apartments, it's dismal. Those are part of the problem.  Rent control is bad.You are absolutely right.  The middle class and singles with one income are hit the worst. You have a decent job but you can't live comfortably. Yeah, because demand is that much greater than supply. High income housing needs will always be met first because they are more profitable, but once that glut is met moderate and then lower income will be targeted. But again, that's not happening, because there's so much world demand, and so little physical space and time.It's not happening in developed Western cities across the globe.People looking to buy/rent properties as domiciles are being priced out of the market by people looking to buy them as investments, and that return on investment is leading developers to build more expensive housing because they want a high return.So it's snowballing where the residents are getting priced out of their own cities.  People that would have rented before have to double up or move.  People that would have bought before have to rent.  People that do buy buy later because rent is so high.The end game is a city where nobody that lives there owns a home except the ultra-rich.  And that's most Americans most valuable investment historically.The fundamental problem is that housing is supposed to be first and foremost a place where you live, ***not*** some grand fucking investment scheme.Can you do both? Sure. But lets put the primary focus on housing people first before anything else.IIRC Los Angeles is dealing with increases in both rent *and* vacancies. LA is dealing with massive rent increases while one prominent neighborhood (Downtown) is dealing with a return to normal and healthy vacancy rates.  The city as a whole though is wrecked with maybe the worst housing policies on the planet.Zoning is at the core of America's affordability crisisFor years i had resisted buying a house because i did not want the headaches i thought would come with owning one but rising rent, poor or almost no repair service is the primary reason i finally did what my son had been urging me to do for years and broke down and bought a home. I bought a 4 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath,etc. just built house ( I had to wait 2 months for them to finish building it before i could complete the paperwork and move in) but it was worth the wait and it is in a good area and my mortgage payments,including property taxes come to less then i would pay to rent a similar house or apartment.My total cost for mortgage, property taxes, homeowners insurance and food insurance comes to less then $10,000 a year. I live in Katy, Texas and love it. Even with paying extra for flood insurance ( I live in a low to medium flood risk area) i am playing less than i would if i rented. I am very happy i did it and just wished i had did it sooner.Three new apartment complexes in my city. And not being filled because people cannot afford, or they can only afford a couple months then they're behind. No low rent facilities are even considered for planning. Yet the city government whines about the homelessness and low economics of the city. No one has money because it all goes to rent!It's fucking nuts where I live (Reno). A couple tech companies open warehouses and all of the sudden everyone makes 6 figures I guess. Almost all new construction in this town are apartments or townhomes, and not affordable either. Apparently if you drop a granite counter top in a kitchen and have a retro but new wave design it's a luxury apartment, even if it's in an area of town where you didn't want to be alone at night 10 years ago, and you then should charge &gt;$1.5 PER square foot for this living. The hip new thing is to build the apartments on top of a mall, so then you get to fork over all your money to one company when payday comes in. It's fucking retarded. There are parts of California where it is cheaper to live right now, and not slimy parts either. Wages don't grow either, and from what I understand working at tesla is hell. Low pay, long hours, grueling work. Our three major industries are gambling, warehouses, and hospitality, people can't afford (and I'm not making this up) $1500 for a 600 square foot apartment. Those are bay area prices. This isn't the bay area. At least the bay has ameoba music and good shows. I can't wait till we have another recession and all these "luxury" apartments are slums. Why Millennials aren't buying houses because the rent is too damn high.You mean Chinese people investing into keeping houses empty. Let's be honest here. Our governments are selling us out.Can't they just live in a tent?We clearly just need to build more bridges.yeah, but the rents are outrageous, just like those fancy refrigerator boxesNewsflash: You DO NOT have to live in NYC, LA, SF, Boston, DC, Seattle, etc. There are plenty of mid sized cities around the country with reasonably priced housing and plenty of jobs. You won't look as cool on Instagram living in Albany NY or Richmond VA, but you'll be able to live a damn nice life.I live in Seattle. The big problem is a large influx of high paying jobs, followed by a large influx of high end apartments driving the cost of living and property values/taxes through the roof. I'm not sure I'd make the same amount of money out side of the city for the work I do, but I know I'm underpaid. I also know, that thanks to the for mentioned issue with apartments, that more and more low end wage earners are moving out of the city and commuting. This results in a multi hour daily commute, and driving up prices for rents in the smaller cities. And it's also worth noting that many people do in fact need to live in the city due to transportation costs. I don't own a car (I walk or bus everywhere). In order to move out of the city is have to buy one and take on they $200-500 a month In car related costs. The reality is, cost of living is going up but pay isn't. &gt; *"The reality is, cost of living is going up but pay isn't."*This is the only piece of information that matters.I live in Kirkland and have worked out of Bellevue for the past 7 years. I moved here (from Yakima) fresh out of college for an engineering job. My rent has gone up $100/mo each year. My 8 mile commute was 40-70 minutes (each way).  I took a  new job in Bothell 90 days ago, my new commute is 10 minutes (each way). It has improved my life drastically...If i buy in Kirkland, it will be a small condo.  Otherwise, I will have to move somewhere else to buy a home.Because you're living in Seattle.  It's one of the hot spots in the US right now. Everybody wants to live there.Ummm I *don't* but my town had a disaster where a lot of units where ruined and afterwards, all the new places being built were luxury apartments. On top of that, now there's a refinery boom. A one bedroom apartment runs around 600 and up *if you can even find one*. The cheapest two bedroom was $800 and everything else is $1000 and up. That's just for apartments. You can just forget houses.That sounds super cheap? How much should a two bedroom cost? For the area, it's not cheap. It's cheap if you're lucky to get a plant job. But the majority of the jobs available are minimum wage.Who will do all the bullshot jobs? Robots, eventually. We need UBII don't know man , but making 20-30k less doesn't sound like a "damn nice life".Except the cost of living can be 20-30k lessExcept when you go to retire, the person who has been saving 10% more in actual cash than you every year because of a higher income can now move to your area with whatever that compounded amount is at the higher amount.Example: I make 100k in NYC. My living costs are 50k, and I save 50k. You live in Cleveland and make 70k a year. Your living costs are 35k and your savings are 35k. We both have the same percentage of our paychecks going to living costs and savings, and you are making and spending the exact amount less than me. But I am still saving 15k more a year, which can earn a return above your savings. Even ignoring higher investment returns, that is 300k in 20 years extra. So not only will I have extra income from investment returns (expect doubling your investments every 10 years), but I can eventually leave this high cost of living area with my much greater savings, and move to Cleveland and retire 15 years earlier than you can retire. Even staying in the same area with all things being equal, my additional savings netted me more cash than my salary did.Problem with your math here being that income is taxed more as it goes up, so the person would have to earn like $100k pre tax on order to have $75k take-home, and $150k or so to have $100k take-home...But I get what you're sayingPlus I don't necessarily buy into the notion that living costs scale proportionally with incomeAt a certain point, food is not going to cost more than a certain amount. A person that is making 30k a year might spend 4k a year on food, but that doesn't mean a person making 300k a year is spending 40k on food. A lot of things max out at a certain point. It is mainly just rent/housing that scales up proportionately.The salary I make in Denver is comparable to an 114% increase in San Francisco. I have a feeling I make out a bit more with cost of living adjustments.My wife and I moved from Southern California to Albuquerque for a residency in optometry.  We always thought we'd end up living in Southern California, but a combination of factors (good people, food, weather) including a *much* lower cost of living incentivized us to stay.  That and the fact that as an optometrist out here, she can make at least 1.75x what she would have made in SoCal due to the high demand.As a cost of living barometer, when we first moved here we were in a newish two-bedroom town home with an attached 2-car garage.  Water and trash included, under $1k a month.  Yeah Albuquerque isn't the most up and coming metropolitan paradise, but the community is great, opportunity is greater, and for the cost of living I'll happily take it.Not all jobs are easily transferable to any local, an optometrist is also a fairly high paying field and has demand pretty much anywhere people live.In most of coastal California, an entry level optometrist makes between 60k and 70k, and the demand is quite low due to saturation of new docs. Couple that with the average 2k/mo 1bed rent (not in high end areas), and you're now taking home at least 1/3 less of your income. One could apply this to many professions in these cities/States; even if the pay is annually 10k to 15k greater, you're still sacrificing much more to CoL and end up saving less. Buying a home is even more difficult as the average house in southern California costs $600k.This. Every time people talk about the wonders of their boring ass towns I point out that many industries literally chain you to major metro areas.I'm a TV news producer and unless I want to make 30-34k a year, I have to live in a major city.Last time I looked for work in these no where locations I'd be lucky to pull in 25-35k with jobs that have far less upward mobility and rarely offer any really benifits. Yeah some fields are in demand everywhere but not all.True, but most of those areas are car dependent. And have much lower paying jobs unless you like long add commutes.All the good jobs are centralized in major cities.But...you don't understand. There are like literally no software dev jobs outside of San Francisco. Even if there was I would be living in some barren wasteland with nothing to eat. Do you really expect me to live without my over priced hipster restaurants? More importantly what would the people on instagram think? Do those other places even have electricity? I just can't even right now. Now excuse me while I go one up someone about how I pay $4000 a month for a dilapidated studio apartment in the worst part of town.lol i know this was sarcastic but i seriously see this sentiment all the time on reddit. its the sentiment many people hold but wont admit it to themselves.You see all the time, people are almost proud to pay 2500+ in rent, like its some badge of honor. No, sorry dude you are a sucker. And that's why im a landlord lolI don't know if there is a name for it but I call it "pity bragging". Typically used when talking about rent or how little sleep they got.I cut myself on that edge.What rich people/landlord are seeing: Rents can still go higher as tenants are not broken yet.Alternatively: buy real estate as people can still be tapped into like a piggy bank.Yet housing construction is still in historically low.This is why Bane was popular Houses are cheap and plentiful in Middle America. Jobs are not.There always has to be someone in the breadbasket to post this, it's like it's the only endorsement they can come up with to try to keep up with people moving out."Houses are cheap here!"That's because they do nothing to entice people to move there. They can't even entice people to retire there.The solution has always been to build more public housing and implement gentle rent control over time.It actually shocked me that taxi drivers could afford to live in downtown Lisbon due to their heavy rent control policy, where people paying 20 euros a month live next to people paying 2000Rent control is bad if you don't increase supply alongside it, and there hasn't yet been a public housing program big enough to accommodate the drastic drop in new private-sector apartments.the market does a pretty good job of housing shortages.  the problem is nimbyism and rent control controlling the market instead of the other way around.  higher rents will cause more people to invest in housing, which causes more housing = more people living in that area than before.  rent control will limit investment and/or construction.NIMBYism doesn’t account for the fact that the bay areas geography has already maximized how much can be built without tearing down buildings of historical worth. It’s true they could plow over entire parts of the city to build HK style super towers but that would destroy the point of the Bay Area. More housing added today just means a wider glut of luxury housing pricing out the middle classes. Rent control and public housing run for breakeven purposes rather than profit is the only solution Moar!https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/us/politics/us-inflation-remains-low-and-thats-a-problem.htmlThat dude in the suit and gloves was right all along.

Lol.Let's tax everyone 100% to put 100% of money into the economy.Actually, government spending has a 10x impact on the economy due to the money multiplier.In other words: for every $1 that the US increases its domestic spending, the economy increases by $10.So let's all stop bitching about Trump spending money on himself, then. :)No, not that kind of spending.We’re talking road works, stuff like that.

And so continues the Statue Wars of '17.I got so confused when I read '17.Speed of the news cycle made me think I'm already in 2018. Things are happening too fast.Doesn't seem like something Maryland would be likely to push for.Seems like a jurisdictional battle rather than actually wanting to put the statues back up.Yeah I read this more like the Maryland Historical Trust is asserting it's ability to do this by the letter of the law, but they don't plan on actually doing it. Basically making sure Baltimore knows they technically have jurisdiction. they just want Baltimore to give them money.&gt; they technically have jurisdictionI can just see a Seargent of the Maryland Historical Trust screaming at the BPD that they have jurisdiction.  Next on Law and Order: Monuments"No way you're taking our case of the Missing Monuments away from us, we have jurisdiction!"The only reason Maryland didn't secede was because Lincoln suspended hapius corpus and started locking people up without being charged with a crime. There was too much risk of D.C. Being surrounded by Confederate territory.Lincoln suspended habeas corpus long after the states that were to secede, seceded. Not saying it wasn't a bad move, but Maryland secession wasn't the reason.Yes it was, Maryland was on the verge of sesession. They were a slave state. Just because it happened later doesn't mean anything. The war was pretty unpopular after so many union defeats early on and public opinion really only started to shift after Grant was put in command and started winning.So, just because the primary point of your argument is made up nonsense doesn't mean they didn't do what they didn't actually do?Tell me then, since you know better than my history professor did, why did Lincoln suspend habeas corpus?&gt;In the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville in August, Baltimore Mayor Catherine E. Pugh ordered the removal of four statues in Baltimore, including those commemorating Confederate generals, soldiers and sailors, and women, **and one of Roger Taney, the chief justice of the Supreme Court who wrote the Dred Scott decision declaring black Americans had no civil rights.**Interestingly, the state doesn’t have the authority to put his statue back up.&gt;The dispute with the state historical trust arose because of a 1984 contract between the state and the city that gives the state body the final say on any changes to the monuments. **The contract doesn’t apply to the statue of Taney.**Dred Scott and Taney should be much wider known - as a reminder of how fucked the US supreme court is.In recent years conservatives,  especially on reddit, get roasted for hating the supreme court, when really everyone should hate a supreme court that legislates.Is it just me, or is the Baltimore city government in the national news far more than a city of 600,000 should be?They don’t call it bodymore murderland for no reasonThey don't call it Pebbles McDonutlamp for nothing either. [Baltimore's been rioting since 1861.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_in_the_American_Civil_War#Baltimore_Riot_of_1861)I read that as rotting, and it works either way.Some cities are just that shitty.Baltimore is up there.Baltimore metro area is almost 3 millions. ...Thanks for that fun fact, but the Baltimore city government has no authority over Annapolis or Baltimore County. So comparing the population of their jurisdiction makes sense doesn't it?I think the point is that Baltimore news is relevant to those people in a direct way cause they work and shop and have various other connections to the city, not that the city gov has jurisdiction over them. Thats a fair point.It's the 30th largest city in the country, plus has more historical prominence and pop culture relevance than places like El Paso, Forth Worth, or Phoenix. When you have as many problems as we do it’s no surprise we’re in the spotlight so much I mean it’s right near DC and some of the most affluent counties in the US.to be fair, Baltimore is like Chicago Jr...it gets highlighted in conservative news a lot because "Baltimore" is code for "blacks".  Don't get me wrong, Baltimore has some problems, but it is also an awesome city.  Also, it's proximity to DC keeps it in the spotlight more than if it was in the middle of nowhere.  When shit happens 30 miles down the road from the Nation's Capital it is bigger news than when the same thing happens in Montana.  Larry Hogan is not dumb enough to die on this hill.This is a Maryland Historical Trust thing. The governor's evolution on the issue actually led to the removal of a Taney statue in Annapolis, where he had a vote on the State House TrustCarcetti stirring things up as always. Real title:Baltimore lacked authority to take down Confederate statues, and state says it could — but won't — order them restoredI'm just here to point out the very obvious title discrepancy.Why'd you do it OP?The title above was the headline when the article was first postedFor the sweet, sweet karma. They'll just get torn down again. Waste of taxpayer money.Not to mention how anti-usa the statues areYup.  Fuck history that hurts feelings.Exact opposite Hey buttfucker, that's a down vote button not a disagree button.Good to know, big man.Hey you're not the buttfucker!But on a serious note, regardless of who's side the are on, any reddit user should be upset when they see someone like /u/boogiebuttfucker in a thread down voting every single post that they disagree with.I didn't downvote or upvote anyone in this thread. We can learn history without having statues to traitors. Ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? Me neither, there're no statues of him.What about Anwar al-Awlaki? In my opinion, part of the reconciliation process between North and South -- given that they were shooting at each other -- is that the North, as acknowledged victors, be magnanimous winners.Part of that magnanimousness is, or should be, a refusal to be petty and resist the urge to crow about it. They won the war; what is there to gain by lambasting the south about it?To put it in another perspective, what the Allies did after World War I to Germany was humiliate them. Make them pay for the war, impose a bunch of crazy restrictions on them, and bankrupt their economy trying to "make it right". Which led, significantly, into another world war. What the Allies did after the end of the Second World War with the Nazis was to immediately give Germany its dignity back.Nowadays, Germany is a firm member of the Allies, and absolutely "one of the good guys". One of these approaches worked a lot better than the other.Now. I know what you're going to say. "Do you see any statues to Hitler in Germany today?", and of course, the answer is no. Nor do I think there should be. Furthermore, I don't believe that the statues in the US should really have been put up in the first place. But the point is, they *are* there, and it behooves the North to remember that they won the war. The North got their way and the southern states didn't succeed. What's the harm in letting them have a few statues to commemorate their attempt, and let them feel a little pride?With all that said, however, at the end of the day, they're just statues. If they all have to go away... well, eh.&gt;What the Allies did after the end of the Second World War with the Nazis was to immediately give Germany its dignity back.That's not what the Allies did at all. We made the Germans bury the bodies of the Jews. We put their leaders on trial, and made them answer for their crimes. We divided their country between the victorious powers, rewrote their legal code, and stationed troops in Germany indefinitely.We abolished the corporations that had assisted the Nazis, outlawed the political groups that were affiliated with the Nazis and began a long campaign of de-Nazification. We destroyed all the symbols of the Third Reich and even engaged in forcible population transfers, uprooting German communities that had flourished for centuries. US federal occupation of the South lasted for a bit more than a decade. Germany didn't regain full sovereignty for 50 years.&gt;We made the Germans bury the bodies of the Jews.The North also freed the Southern slaves.&gt;We put their leaders on trialBecause Germany's surrender was unconditional. At the surrender at Appomattox, one of the terms offered by Grant was that the surrendered would be free to return to their homes "not to be disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside."If the North had indeed had a Nuremberg Trial for the south it would have been a violation of their agreement. Furthermore, there [were actually trials and executions of Confederate officers and leaders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wirz) but, for this reason, they were generally only conducted with the approval of the southern states.&gt; We divided their country between the victorious powersOnly because the Soviet Union wanted more territory and was in a position to take it. That wasn't a concession the US made willingly and in the Civil War there was no foreign powers trying to steal Southern territory.&gt;, rewrote their legal codeThis isn't really the same situation because Germany didn't become part of America.&gt;, and stationed troops in Germany indefinitely.Again, Germany remained its own nation.&gt;We abolished the corporations that had assisted the NazisLike [Bosch, Mercedes, Deutsche Bank, and Volkswagen, who used 300,000 concentration camp slaves, right?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2663635/Revealed-How-Nazis-helped-German-companies-Bosch-Mercedes-Deutsche-Bank-VW-VERY-rich-using-slave-labor.html) All put out of business.&gt;outlawed the political groups that were affiliated with the NazisThe 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments were implemented immediately in the post-war period, and no southerner could vote if he had taken part in the rebellion against the Union.&gt;We destroyed all the symbols of the Third ReichI agree that the Confederate statues should not have been put up in the first place but they are there now.&gt;US federal occupation of the South lasted for a bit more than a decade. Germany didn't regain full sovereignty for 50 years.Granted, but part of that was because of the Cold War and the USSR on their doorstep. It's not really an accurate comparison. The US was basically protecting them from invasion.It's not like the North couldn't have sought unconditional surrender from the South. The North wasn't particularly interested in ending racism either, though, to their credit, they weren't keen on slavery. In any case, the whole 'with malice toward none and charity toward all' died when Lincoln was assassinated.I'm not trying to make the comparison between the end of the Civil War and the end of WWII. I'm just saying that the end of WWII did not leave the Germans their dignity. The changes after WWII were far more sweeping than after WWI. Germany today takes no pride in its wartime history, instead they take pride in their defense of human rights and the rule of law. I don't want the South to take pride in its slave-owning past; I'd like them to become champions of freedom and justice today.&gt;It's not like the North couldn't have sought unconditional surrender from the South.Oh, sure. Absolutely. I mean, they could have, if they wanted to press for it. But they didn't.Part of why they didn't was because Lincoln was seriously worried that the union would be permanently and irreparably harmed by the civil war and wanted to try and mend bridges as quickly as he could.Lincoln wasn't a god and maybe there might have been a better way to do things, but it did seem like a pretty good move. There hasn't been another civil war since the first one. Seems like whatever he did, it worked.&gt;The North wasn't particularly interested in ending racism either, though, to their credit, they weren't keen on slavery. Oh, sure, on both counts.&gt;In any case, the whole 'with malice toward none and charity toward all' died when Lincoln was assassinated.I wouldn't say it died, but... yeah, that didn't help at all.&gt;I'm not trying to make the comparison between the end of the Civil War and the end of WWII. I'm just saying that the end of WWII did not leave the Germans their dignity. The changes after WWII were far more sweeping than after WWI.Yeah, I guess I understand what you're saying. I think there's a *profound* difference between the changes post-WWI vs post-WWII and I think a lot of them were, in fact, aimed at preserving German dignity because they *specifically* targeted Nazi-ism rather than the German identity. There wasn't that disconnect between "The South" and "Southern Ideology" now or then, so I don't know how they could have done the same thing.&gt;Germany today takes no pride in its wartime history, instead they take pride in their defense of human rights and the rule of law.Absolutely true, but I also think they have developed a kind of cultural self-destructiveness that isn't helpful. Maybe it's only a vocal minority, but it seems like there's a real pathological self-hatred among a lot of the German people which I feel is not helpful or healthy.Germany today is totally different from the Reich. Almost all the people alive from that time are now dead, and anyone who isn't was either an infant at the time or is now extremely ancient. At a certain point, people have to let go of the past.&gt;I don't want the South to take pride in its slave-owning past; I'd like them to become champions of freedom and justice today.It's hard to explain, but...I don't think it's about the past, what it was, and what it stood for. It's about letting the past *be the past*. It's about looking back and going, "Wow, those were some serious mistakes, glad we're not doing that any more". Which people are less likely to do if the victors are standing over them going "Hey, remember that bad thing you did literally hundreds of years ago? Yeah, because of that, we're going to take down these monuments and you don't get a say in that."That only brings back the divisions that existed and makes people angry again. It's saying that the *present* should be responsible for and answer for the *past*, erasing that divide.I'm saying we should strengthen the divide.Now that would be funnyMaybe if it weren't Maryland.  If the state itself has the authority to remove statues, it will grant it after a 30 minute hearing in the legislature.  Dam Libtards, amirite?Lawlessness in Baltimore? Say it ain't so!Is it possible they've already been melted down already? If not, what's stopping them? Georgia (or counties therein) is wiping servers related to lawsuits, melting down a statue can't be considered nearly as bad.Nah, they're at a city-owned lot.Time for a compromise. Melt down all the metal Confederate statues into second place trophies and hand them out to the cry babies.don't be too sad, at least maryland ranked 22nd in corruption, right smack in the middle of the pack, can't be too bad.https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18822/how-does-your-state-rank-integritySo, Baltimore should physically destroy the monuments immediately in order to prevent big government nanny states forcing them to have and maintain shit they don't want? Or save that response for the red states that would actually force it back up?I really would love to see the look on their faces while the monuments were slowly put back up. I would pay a decent chunk of change for some popcorn and good seats to watch their expressions.Edit: Holy shit o.o Here are some of them nowEdit: Crikey! Look at em! The liberal in their native habitat /r/news.Keep dreaming bruhYou enjoy human misery?Misery over a statue being put up? Yes I think that's ridiculous and hilarious.Edit: Aww I'm sowwy wibewals.. :(You wouldn't have a problem with a Lenin statue being erected in your town?Well no but I'm not sure what that has to do with American Civil War-era statues. They're very separate eras and circumstances. A Lenin statue would never be erected in my small Tennessee college town. Oddly enough we don't have notable Confederate statues here either although I am proud to say we have a Confederate war memorial in the cemetery just down the street where my father is buried.I might have to actually protest if they try to take that down but I doubt they will. Then again... College town. Colleges these days are full of liberals.  We'll see.Edit: Sigh.. I wish they'd actually discuss with me instead of downvoting and flinging insults and baseless insinuations.. Accusations.. Oh well.You're so pissed off a liberals in your school and you support the Confederacy?I wouldn't say I support the Confederacy but I do acknowledge and admire the way they fought. I'm not trying to constantly be offended about shit that happened closer and closer to 200 fucking years ago...But that's just me.Edit: 2017. 1861-1865. 😄😄😄😄Those statues didn't get erected 200 years ago.  A lot of them are from the 1920s and 1950s.Karl Marx died in 1883 and people still lose their shit about him.I understand that and their reasoning behind losing their shit. Tearing down and defacing them though.. That is not understandable. You don't get to pick and choose which laws you like and which ones you just want to bypass and do yourself anyway..If they got them taken down by a legal process well fuck yeah. Good for them! If they got put back up legally fuck yeah good for those who actively want that.That's because people still listen to Marx like he was some sort of prophet. You should ask about ol' Bobby Lee down in Dixie.Remember kids, during a war, always set aside your monument fund so that memorials can be built as soon as the cease fire is declared.Or don't build statues of the vanquished on the land of the victors.  You lost, get over it.&gt; I wouldn't say I support the Confederacy but I do acknowledge and admire the way they fought.What is to admire? The most amazing thing about the Confederate military is that 85% of military age males served in the infantry.   The only reason this worked is because they had 4 million slaves to fill the void left in the workforce.Seriously, please, just look into the civil war.  Actually learn about it.I'm really, really worried about the complete lack of knowledge the average American reddit or seems to have on the bloodiest war their country ever fought.There's something called courage and resolve even in the face of certain defeat against an army which had more and better industry behind it. I like the underdog too. They knew they were going to lose after a certain point and they kept fighting. I admire that and I'm not going to let someone tell me I can't.I admire the Japanese of WW2. They did awful things but I still admire their individual courage...So then let's start putting up statues to Imperial Japan. We can put them next to all the Confederate statues.Monuments to those foolish enough to challenge the American armed forces.The confederacy fought miserably. Just sayin. They were outnumbered, blockaded and the North had superior industry... I never said they strategically fought well. They lost the war. That should go without saying.. Usually..I meant their courage.What courage? I'm glad that you just flat out tell people how little you know so they don't actually believe you.Just stating the facts. Sorry for offending I guess. What about the misery of the folks that were oppressed by the people the statues represent? Is their struggle and loss "ridiculous ad hilarious" too?Well no I didn't say that but I don't think facts really matter to people like you any more. To you I am a racist because of a Reddit post about popcorn and statues...In this same comment you are calling me out for making assumptions based on a reddit post, then you say "people like you", generalizing who you think I am based on..... a single reddit post.Not to mention I said nothing about race and asked simple questions for clarification. It seems to me you are the one making general assumption about the who's and what's. But I'm sure you can understand why some folks don't want memorials of other people who oppressed their ancestors in quite an inhumane fashion.You got me. I am horrible and I want to continue that oppression. I'm using Reddit as my platform for this. Still working out the kinks though.I never said you are horrible .... I didn't "get you" on anything. I'm just making sure you can understand the other side of the argument.No no, it's okay. I am on a ruthless march and I will... WILL bring back the Confederacy. THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN.Oh fuck yeah. Almost like watching the Hillary camp after Trump won, except probably less civil.Let's make a Hillary statue, then. Statues are supposed to remind us who lost, right?Why is there a confederate statue ~~north of the mason dixon~~ anyways? They lost a long time ago. Shouldn't they be over it by now?The Mason-Dixon line is the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It's actually L-shaped. The vertical border of Maryland and Delaware is also part of it. &gt; "L-Shaped."How fitting.Yup. Learned that now.  I always thought it was the straight line border running south of west virginia and virginia.It was still a long time ago and they need to quit crying about it cause it makes them look like babies.Also, pro-Southern sentiment ran very strong in Baltimore in 1861 and Lincoln effectively had to occupy the city with Federal troops:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_riot_of_1861I actually work pretty close to a former [plantation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_National_Historic_Site) in Baltimore county and drive past the slave quarters everyday. We still seem a little to proud of that place if I'm being honest. Edit: I said *proud* that doesn't mean it should not exist. Come on. Try your hardest to keep spreading that white guilt, some day hopefully we will be ashamed of everything!Yeah, that's not really the side of history I grew up with, so I'm not exactly hugging the southern identity tight. The only reason Maryland didn't join the Confederacy was because Lincoln suspended hapias corpus and started having people locked up without being charged with a crime. It was too risky to allow D.C. to be surrounded by Confederate territory.So now you guys are pro-lincoln?  What happened to the whole "the partys didn't switch" arguments? Did the confederats treat their prisoners well? How about their slaves?  Who is you guys? What are you assuming about me? I merely stated historical fact.You have a comment history.  You defend the confederacy a lot. Your fellow confederacy defenders used the argument that the party switch never happened, and they used it a lot.You are completely misrepresenting my position. Why would you think I wouldn't support Lincoln? He held our country together during its most trying time. He, Washington, and Jefferson are aurguably the most important Americans there have been in my opinion. I've never once said anything supporting the confederacy. I merely point out that hindsight is 20/20 and they were defending the only way of life they knew. It ruffles my jimmies when people compare Confederates to the Nazis as systematically exterminating a race has never been a *normal* part of the human condition but slavery had been pretty common in virtually every culture for most of our species' existence.  Those who actually fought and died against the Confederates seemed to understand that our country had some shit it needed to work out, and luckily the right side won. There is a reason Soldiers from *both* sides are officially United States Veterans.I never knew that, about Confederates officially being US veterans. That kinda warmed my heart. That's a really classy gesture.&gt; Why is there a confederate statue north of the mason dixon anyways?Technically, it *is* south of the [Mason-Dixon Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason%E2%80%93Dixon_line), since that line marks the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania.That being said, Maryland was never formally part of the Confederacy, and has no place advocating for those statutes to be put back up... Well I'll be damned, you're right. I always thought it was below virginia and west virginia. Til.   Why do you hide behind ignorance instead of learning about your fellow countrymen, and the bloodiest war ever fought by our country?I dont consider those who fight against freedom, and for slavery to be fellow countrymen. I consider them traitors to the united states and terrorists when they commit political acts of violence.  They are criminals and should be treated as such, according to their level of involvement.  You should read about the civil war, it's pretty interesting and you will learn somethings.Why do you hide behind ignorance instead of learning about your fellow countrymen, and the bloodiest war ever fought by our country?Because they are not about the war, they a signal of white supremacy To be a bit more cynical about this... did taking down the statues actually work?  Did the murder rate drop after they were removed?  Did the city actually make any measurable improvements in crime or education or anything important?  Or was it just a stunt, and a distraction from real, non-trivial issues?Society can work on more than one thing at a time. It's not the starcraft barracks queueIn theory.  But, did it?  Has Baltimore actually been working on anything else in a way that has delivered measurable improvements?  From what I've read, murders (for example) haven't dropped in frequency since the statue incident.  So... what else HAS the city been working on?Non sequitur argument, 10 points from gryffindor Would putting them back up have any measureable improvement?  Did putting them up in the first place help anything?It helped signal to other racists that they still believe in the subjugation of their fellow countrymen &gt; To be a bit more cynical about this... did taking down the statues actually work? Yes, it worked in removing people who generally fought against the United States, and don't deserve to have monuments dedicated to them.&gt;Did the murder rate drop after they were removed? Did the city actually make any measurable improvements in crime or education or anything important? All of those things are completely unrelated (??).  I stopped an ice cream truck as it drove by outside last night.  Did I create a drop in crime with that?  (I see these statements as equally related).&gt;Or was it just a stunt, and a distraction from real, non-trivial issues?Oh I see,  you're just trying to paint statue removal as counterproductive because removing monuments to traitors didn't end world hunger.  Of course.So by this analysis, you seem to find Slavery to be a trivial issue. It's 2017 dude, time to get learned. Slavery is bad.Serves the left right for going full talibanSays the person taking the side of pro-slavery.Supporting the remembrance of Americans and American history is not the same as supporting slavery. The Civil War was a crucial part of the country's history, and it should be remembered as accurately as possible. When you start tearing down Confederate monuments, you create an opening for people to twist history even further to fit the narrative that racism was the only cause of the Civil War.&gt;to twist history even further to fit the narrative that racism was the only cause of the Civil War.What were the other causes of the Civil War?The Confederacy didn't want to continue slavery out of racism, there were many southerners that supported equality. The main problem Confederate states had with Lincoln's abolishment of slavery was that many southerners (especially in South Carolina) viewed it as the federal government trying to take power away from the state governments. Secondarily, the South's entire economy was built up around slavery since the region was first colonized; to simply free all the slaves at once would have (and in some ways did) destroy the economy of those southern states. There were very valid reasons for the war on both sides, and it's important to remember that it was Americans fighting Americans. Both the Union and the Confederacy have their places in history, and they deserved to be remembered.&gt;viewed it as the federal government trying to take power away from the state governments. So why'd they support the Fugitive Slave Act, which required free states to return escaped slaves? Isn't that an equally unconstitutional federal overreach?&gt;Secondarily, the South's entire economy was built up around slavery since the region was first colonized; to simply free all the slaves at once would have (and in some ways did) destroy the economy of those southern states. So why not just replace all the black slaves with white ones? If it's not about racism, why did the South only want to keep blacks enslaved?The South had no problem freeing white slaves, despite its impact on their economy -- why not just let the blacks go free and enslave the whites?It's impressive to meet this kind of ignorance.Why not have white slaves? They'd be just as beneficial to the South's economy -- wouldn't they?If the South was really that concerned with its economy, why did it forbid the owning of white slaves by non-whites? Why did it eventually forbid white slavery in its entirety?"Why not have white slaves? They'd be just as beneficial to the South's economy -- wouldn't they?"From where at the price and quantity available from Africa? "If the South was really that concerned with its economy, why did it forbid the owning of white slaves by non-whites? Why did it eventually forbid white slavery in its entirety?"Because they, like every other person in America were racist?Did you think the north wasn't racist towards blacks?Again, it's just amazing seeing someone so ignorant in the wild.  The civil war is extremely interesting and I strongly suggest researching it!  And you're not going to like this, but you're going to need to go outside of reddit, and even read from viewpoints you don't agree with.  But in the end you will actually know what you're talking about.&gt;From where at the price and quantity available from Africa? Debtor's prisons. You get slaves for free from whites who can't pay their bills. You don't have to import them at all.&gt;Because they, like every other person in America were racist?But the poster above me said that there were other reasons for the Civil War beyond mere racism. What I'm arguing is that racism is the *sine qua non* of the Civil War. Without racism, the Civil War would never have happened. With racism, the Civil War was unavoidable. Racism was the but for cause of the American Civil War.Remember that there was a massive international slave trade. Slaves were primarily sourced from Africa and exported around the globe, which is why slaves were primarily black. You can't just replace black slaves with white slaves, as there's no real source for a massive white slave trading network. Also remember that slaves were considered property at the time. With that legal view, not returning an escaped slave was comparable to stealing from the slave holder, which is what the Fugitive Slave Act was based on.&gt;You can't just replace black slaves with white slaves, as there's no real source for a massive white slave trading network. Just enslave debtors. Make sure that the descendants of slaves are born slaves too. The international slave trade stopped in 1807, all the growth from then until 1860 was from descendants of slaves.If slavery, not racism, was what was important to the South, why did they forbid the enslavement of whites? How does that help their economy? You obviously have no idea what you are talking about. No one forbade white slavery, and indentured servitude of Europeans was quite common, it just couldn't match the scale of black slavery that the slave trade had created. This is like 5th grade history.&gt;No one forbade white slavery, and indentured servitude of Europeans was quite commonIndentured servitude was for a limited period, and any child born during servitude was born free. Imprisonment for debt ended federally in 1833, and ended in Virginia in 1849. But chattel slavery for whites was illegal. There were lots of whites who would have made good, strong workers. If slavery was so important to the South's economy, why did it prevent 80+% of its population from being enslaved? At least your username matches your philosophy.That was the right who were commiting terrorist acts like running over crowds of people.  You should stop watching fake news because it is misinforming you.The South will rise again!?They would be saying they openly hate the United States and Americans if they do Does the US Army hate America by having a rather large base named after Robert E Lee?But won't.All statues of Confederate "heroes" should come down, everywhere; they represent so much negative about our history, and promote nothing positive by remaining.what if somebody loped off the statue's head and absconded, the head never to be seen again. pretty hard to repair the statue without spending a lot of taxpayer money on it."Fuck you, send in the National Guard"i live here. this city and state overall is incredibly racist, both white and black. you put these statues back up you'll have more problems then if you just let this whole thing die.just let it go unless you want another riot on your hands. 
Paid lawmakers to rewrite law to allow this to happen. Other news Politicians find someone to blame even though they took the money and made the law. Should look into how former Congressman [Billy Tauzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Tauzin#Career_as_a_lobbyist) *allegedly* helped Big Pharma make a killing (pun intended) at the expense of the american peopleMeanwhile, the company has been active in politics, donating $500,000 last year to an Arizona campaign to defeat a ballot measure to legalize marijuana.If someone is  willing to take their money/bribes I doubt much will change.  And I doubt this is the first time they have “been active in politics”. It boggles my mind that states that actually allow their voters to pass ballot measures keep failing when it comes to marijuana. Like what the hell are 18-35 year olds doing that could be more important than making sure your state is safer by legalizing marijuana and to stop creating felons out of otherwise upstanding citizens.Good riddance to this guy and his other 6 executives that hopefully get some REAL Jail time and all their worth gets put into Rehab for the uninsured but employed users seeking help. And half-way houses for non-violent users or former addicts that need financial assistance. All that should come from the cash seizures in arrests like these. And Dont stop here. Theres plenty more cases just like this and theres plenty more guilty parties in this case alone that have not been charged...yet.Wait, what about Purdue pharma and the Sacklers' ?Big Pharma will face no penalty in all this. Just like with equifax, just like with the financial crisis. The people who should go to jail won't ever see the inside of a police station, let alone a cell. Just the way it is here in the US. Business controls our gov't, not us. https://youtu.be/exnaY0l4XsM(I link flippantly)lol the investigators think there is some sort of conspiracy. what nutjobs!  ^^^^/sA conspiracy is an agreement between persons who intend to gain some collective advantage while keeping their agreement secret from the public or from other people affected by it.  These things happen all the time.An r/conspiracy nut job, "Hillary runs a demonic child sex ring from the non-existent basement of a pizza shop...also on Mars!!  The Vegas shooting was false flag and hologram from (((deep state)))".  There's a big difference.  Would not be surprised in the slightest of Clinton’s ran a pedo ring &gt; There's a big difference.lol not according to most of reddit there isn't. "seems like there's more to this that we don't know yet"  =  you're a trump supporting nazi who thinks liberals are pedophilesIf we went by "most of reddit," we'd have to be racist, sexist, indifferent to children getting raped, approve of fascism and generally be the worst examples of human beings imaginable in all scenarios possible. Feel free to get triggered though, if you feel that you rather resemble my remark.&gt; "seems like there's more to this that we don't know yet"By the way, that's a fucking unacceptable reason to refuse doing anything about a known, quantified problem with sufficient evidence to proceed.
I am guessing drug binge. Edit: baby was four months old and only weighed seven pounds. Was apparently dead a day but hadn’t been changed or moved in a week.  Maggots were living on the baby. I dunno how long a binge can last but seems like it was neglected from the start?that’s my best guess as well.  i’m reminded of that awful scene from trainspotting "Oh crap... we have a baby, tooooootally forgot for a week"Exact thought I had.  Trainspotting.  That was truly grotesque.There are several comments about *Trainspotting* and I don't get the reference. Is it something I should watch or is does the entire film require eye bleach?It's sorta one of those "amazing films you never want to see again," at least IMO.From what I recall (SPOILER):Pretty similar to this story actually (*if the speculations are true). A bunch of people binging on drugs at an apartment and completely forget there's an infant in the other room. By the time anyone notices, the child is already long dead, and the main character suffers horrifying hallucinations related to this event while going through withdrawal.Technically it's never revealed in the book or the movie how the baby dies.  We don't even know if it was dead for a long time, it's possible it could have suffocated while it slept.  I mean it's probably because they were high for days and forgot about the baby, it's just never specified.That's what happened to a girl from my hometown. Her and the dad and their friends were getting fucked up, baby died of SIDS. Not sure how long the baby was left alone but they ddi deem it a SIDS death so I'm guessing suffocation.Does this rotting swing baby need to be specified?Maybe it had a heart attack from working too late at the officeMan I know you’re just trying to be funny on the internet but this isn’t the article for jokes.I'm not making fun of the dead baby.  The comment is dumb.  How else would a junkie's baby die?  Besides neglect/exposureGo away.I think it happens more often than people think. It happened to a [former] friend of mine. She was super strung out so she left her newborn baby in his crib for (not sure how long, but it was quite awhile) and he died of SIDS while she was on a bender. You just need to see it.  Some movies are worth watching, but the scene that we are all referring to is a harrowing one.  You've been forewarned.If you’re sensitive like me, the entire fucking film requires eye bleach.  It haunted me for weeks after I’d seen it.  i tried to watch it a second time and couldn’t get past the opening scene lolI’m a recovering heroin addict and if you think about it the movie is kinda positive. The entire time Renton is actively trying to get clean. Yeah he falls into use over and over but he eventually gets clean. As far as heroin movies go this one has about the most positive outcome you could hope for. I only got about 20% thru it before turning it off. I am really not into gore disgusting stuff and it started getting to me.So if you can't stand that stuff I would not recommend the movie.Came to say the same. This poor baby is probably yet another victim of the opiate epidemic.Surely the government will do something about this horrible epidemic eventually?   Perhaps something peer reviewed and proven to work like outreach programs, safe cessation programs, and legalization of marijuana?Oh wait just fucking kiddingAs if all these [liberal, government intervention programs](https://recoverybrands.com/drugs-in-america-vs-europe/assets/images/xprevalence-of-opioid-use-once-year-past-year.png.pagespeed.ic.D9hW2Qci7y.png) have any effect at all. /sHahaha holy shit we are pathetic Get off your fucking high horse a lot of those programs are already implemented in a lot of cities in United States and we have a huge fucking problem with it still. So stop acting like you're the all-knowing with the solution to the problem because it's a lot more complex than that.The problem is too big for cities to solve with their limited jurisdiction and resources.  The federal government takes taxes for a reason:  to handle these kinds of problems, but the GOP would rather funnel that tax money into the hands of the already-rich and the military while the country goes off the rails at home.Sorry that hurts your feefees, but that's how it is kiddo.Talking down to me like a kid does not make your point any more accurate it only shows your childish and have to no real things to back it up. You have no clue what you're talking about you really think that the government can just throw money at this problem and make it go away? You just made this post to make a quick unneeded political jab that only dilutes your point which there wasn't much of One to begin with. You give a vibe that you are completely disconnected from the actual reality and gravity of the situation. Even though there's a lot of resources to get help the sad truth is a lot of addicts are not seeking for this help and that is one big issue your little feel good plan will not address. Like I said this issue is way more complex than you're making it out to be.[removed]The opiate epidemic has literally nothing to do with Trump.My brother died of a heroin/fentynal overdose before Trump even became president. Has nothing to do with Trump. Has everything to do with pharmaceutical companies lobbying and getting people addicted to pain pills, regulations being put in place that cut tons of addicts off with no help with withdrawals, the wars in the middle East making the poppy more easily accessible to drug smugglers bringing heroin into the US and heroin replacing pain pills as a cheaper alternative. If anything, it's on Bush and Obama but it's really not political. Trump hasn't had enough time in office to have caused or really even affected this.Edit: and before this is misconstrued, I didn't vote for Trump, either. Not everything is about him. Get over yourself.Here hereWTF does that have to do with Trump?  Shit's been happening for decades.How is the opioid epidemic Trump Propaganda?You just went full retard.You are full retard, get help please.Hurrr durrr durrr So this is the future?Quick everyone kill it with fire before it multiplies.What?! If anything raising the opiate epidemic is an oblique criticism of Republicans.Did you mean anti-Trump propaganda?Reading this as a dad infuriates me.  I could not imagine doing that to my kid when she was that age.  Ugh.they could have just been cult members trying to raise their kids right.I am glad I am not the medical examiner doing an autopsy on the poor baby or the LEO folk that found the sad scene. Horrifying, really.  This is truly tragic.  How does a baby just die in a swing and no one notices?  WTF is wrong with people.They probably noticed. I figured they were too high to notice anything at all.I think if your baby dies due to your neglect while abusing opiates, you probably just double down until you die too.Its nice to reassure ourselves that no one would do something like this unless they were under the influence of drugs, but many perfectly sober parents neglect their children to death both without the excuse of pharmaceutical enhancement and without a single twinge of conscience.I never said such a thing couldnt happen elsewhere. I was explaining their situation, not some other made up one.Of course it happens elsewhere. I simply question the idea that a junkie parent would feel any more regret than a typical non junkie parent when disposing of an unwanted child. For example, the guy I know who ran over his kid when he was drunk didn't go on to drink himself to death. Despite all the myths spun around heroin, junkies aren't uniquely sensitive people.This may be the most disturbing thing I have read. It makes /r/watchpeopledie/ seem tame.HOW THE FUCK DOES A PARENT DO THIS?amazing compartmentalization and denial skills I think.Well, it's not like it was in the house. Out of sight, out of mind!Now excuse me while I vomit.The baby was in the house.Oh...wait, that's even worse. Dear God, this situation is actually far, far worse than I thought it was...How did they not do anything about the maggots? Don't you notice the flies? Why?That's some Trainspotting kind of shit... fucki'm sympathetic to addicts but i really, really hope they go to prison for the rest of their lives.I'm sympathetic to addicts until they start harming other people.What you do to yourself is your business. Violence, neglect, theft, etc? Nope, no addiction sob story points there for the addict or their enablers. Me too, but you stop being a victim as soon as you harm someone else. These people need to go Further details: http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/update-chickasaw-co-infant-died-of-neglect-parents-charged/article_7c1b078e-0c96-5314-be80-5a2244b7bcf8.amp.htmlTLDR: Baby was a four month old but only weighed 7 pounds, died of neglect. &gt;"According to court records, Koehn told authorities Harris had fed the infant around 9 a.m. and everything was fine, and then he checked again at 11 or 11:30 a.m. and the child was dead."&gt;"During the autopsy, the medical examiner found maggots in the boy’s clothing and skin, and the maggots’ development was studied by a forensic entomologist to determine a timeline."&gt;“The study of the maggots growth and development indicated that **the child had not had a diaper change, bath, or been removed from the seat in over a week**,” the deputy wrote in court records."How horrific. The child was only dead for a day or so but was rotting alive in the seat because his deadbeat parents couldn't be bothered to change his diaper, bathe him, or even remove him from the seat for more than a week.You have to feel bad for the medical examiner too, that cant be an image theyre going to be able to forgetSeriously. I mean, to an extent, ME's know what line of work they're getting into. But this is another level. There are some things they could never imagine, much less have to see for themselves. God dammit. This whole fucking thing is just next-level fucked up.Agreed.  You can imagine getting into the ME line of work thinking "oh man, I'm gonna totally prove that from the powder burn marks and trajectory through the organs, the prime suspect killed the victim without a doubt!" or "I'll prove that the boyfriend didn't kill the girlfriend but she did in fact fall by accident!"  Not this.  So it’s more than likely that the child was being eaten alive by maggots?Maggots take up to 20 hours to hatch once the eggs have been laid. The transition of maggot to pupae takes about 3 days and those pupae don't hatch for up to 2 weeks in cold weather and 6 days or less in warm weather.Since their development was used as a timeline to determine that the child's diaper was filled for more than a week, I'd wager some of them had managed to pupate but not hatch, which prompted the conclusion of "the diaper not being changed for more than a week" according to the medical examiner. Tl;DR: Yes, very likelyThat’s terrifying, thanks for the breakdown. As I recall, maggots do not eat healthy tissue.  The maggots did not contribute to this tragedy, but they confirm the timeline of neglect.How the fuck could live while knowing that your sons body is rotting in your backyard! God this makes me angryEdit:spellingIt's actually worse than that! From what I gathered reading the article it was actually the kind of little baby swing that stays inside the house. The poor dead child was in the house in a swing for a week according to the medical examiner.Noo wayy I thought it was a backyard chair kind of swing. Than the smell had to be horrible to!And the rot may have been going on before the baby died... Maggots in the unchanged diaper... The more I read the worse it was.stopi want off this planetfucking hell take me with you pleaseif you don't want company i get it but let's get off world first and then split up afterI thought so too but when they said apartment I figured it was an indoor baby swingEver seen Trainspotting? Yeah, that.It's unfathomable and disgusting.Dude, if you click the title it will actually take you to a news article.  I just recently figured this out.One word: painkillers.Don't blame it on pain killers. This is the fault of shitty shitty people who never should have had a child.Shitty people on drugsAnd this story is exactly why I'm pro-choice.  Some kids are better off never having been born.  I am sick to death of stories like this.  What the fuck.  A baby is so precious and adorable.  How could anyone do this?  We are becoming a country of too many monsters.Being pro-choice is great so long as the person actually aborts the child when they realize that they aren't fit to be a parent. But the problem is is that said person actually has to be self-aware enough to do that.&gt;  But the problem is is that said person actually has to be self-aware enough to do that.Which is why I liked that charity that gave money to drug addicts to get their tubes tied. Said drug addicts still have to be aware enough to get their tubes tied.No, just desperate enough for cashSome are, some aren't. But the choice should be there. For them, for us, for the kid that may be born to die a long or maybe short death.I agree so much with you, it's so easy for many people to take the "noble" approach and demand life be carried through pregnancy. But most pro life advocates understand absolutely nothing about the situations that arise when somebody needs an abortion. Every story like this makes me sick to my stomach. Pro choice doesn't fix the problem if the people like this choose to still have kids.  What we need to stop this is limits on who can be parents.  They can be very loose limits.  As long as they stop lethal levels of neglect it will be worth it.I'm also not in favor of making abortion illegal, but there's a planned parenthood in cedar falls iowa, which looks like the nearest reasonably sized town. The area this in looks super rural. It's not really feasible to set up an abortion clinic in a town that has 250 people in it.Yeah, my daughter turned 4 months old a few days ago. I'm going to skip this article and go hug her and tell her I love her.2-3 comments was too much.I can't comprehend how awful a person must be to do something like this Some people don't deserve to be parents.My kids are slightly older, but I snuggled my 18 month old after seeing this....  and he promptly told me that he wanted me to put on music so we can dance.   We did.  Alot.Spay and Neuter.I don't care if this gets downvoted.This couple needs to be spayed and neutered. Spaying and neutering is too light a punishment, more like 20 years prison w/o paroleCan’t have both?I’m thinking a 180 grains of lead. That is a combination of words I didn't need to read today.Ditto. I think I'll skip this sub for a while.This makes me sick to my stomach. Oh my freaking god.  I have to go hug all my baby cousins.  And the neighbor's babies.And some stranger's babies.  Fuck that is sad.God that was tough to read. Poor baby.That's enough internet for today.What in the actual fuck? I hope they rot.The article doesn't say much about where they lived but how would neighbors not hear a baby crying? Unless of course there's more to this story than the article provides. Infants will stop crying to conserve energy after a time according to some articles I read to prep for mine. Heartbreaking shit...it's like they give up on being helped.Also, if it's a house, odds are no one could hear it crying anyway. Even in some apartments you can't hear babies crying despite being able to hear other types of noises from neighbors.When we went through foster parent training, they told us that they've seen babies less than a month old who don't cry because they've already learned that it doesn't work.That breaks my heart. I can't even fathom it. Awwww well that's heartbreaking. Poor babies,I'll snuggle them.Jesus fucking shitI hate everything nowAlso, some babies cry more than others. So if this baby was crying a lot others could assume they were colicky or had really bad reflux.Baby swings are inside the house. They are to help rick babys to sleep.The town has 250 people in it. Something tells me the next house over isn't exactly wall to wall. Even if it were, babies cry, that probably wouldn't seem that abnormal unless it was for days on end, which I doubt a baby would be able to do.That was my thought too.. like how did no one see this baby rotting away for dead in a swing.  This makes me so sad.  I don't understand how any human can be so terribly evil to an innocent little baby.  It was an indoor swing. No one else could see it but the people in the house.I did read the article, I dont know why I missed that.  o sad.  I often read stories about the no diaper change/ no bath children being found alive but neglected in the homes of heroin addicts.  I see it a lot in our local news.  It really breaks my heart.  I like to think I would notice an issue with my neighbors who have kids and also am quite certain that my lovely but nosey neighbors would be calling children's services on me the moment my kid had any signs of neglect.  My child is in day care which honestly breaks my heart but I'll tell ya, those women treat me like an abuser if there are ANY marks on my kid.  It gives me comfort to know they are noticing and looking out for the children in their care.  All they really do is make sure to alert me and sometimes if I don't alert them first they  will even ask how the bruise / cut came to be &amp; I am truthfully so glad they approach it that way (even if it is to protect them from accusations of being harmed in their care).I just dont understand how anyone can let this happen to a baby.  I really can't handle these stories sometimes.&gt;I don't understand how any human can be so terribly evil to an innocent little baby.Don't ever look up late term abortions.Yea I wouldnt but I also realize that a lot of women getting late term abortions are doing so because of a picture on a screen or some other type of test indicating that their baby is going to die a severely painful death shortly after he or she is born.  I truly can not imagine getting that news as a woman who desperately wants to love on and nurture a precious little angel.  Tragic.  I agree.Good, you seem to understand the purpose of a late term abortion far better than the person you are responding to.They are often the most tragic of choices.. truly heartbreaking - I literally can not even imagine what must go through the mind of a woman / family faced with those decisions..If he was left outside and it was cold/hot or he was dehydrated he could have died fairly quickly, so no crying to be heard.If they had  a fence or their neighbors were far away that would explain why it took so long. The article doesn't state who called the medical team and is missing a lot of fine details, so who knowsHe wasn't outside. This was an inside swing that rocks a baby to sleep.I'm guessing that the baby died and then they put it outside.I've been anti-death penalty all my life. I just changed my mind.See that light in her eyes? Replicant.That seems insulting to replicants.My baby boy just turned four months. I can’t stand hearing him cry for more than a few minutes. Imagine how long this poor baby cried before he passed. Seriously breaks my heart. They are so helpless and precious. I can’t even imagine. fuck. Why did I decide to read this at the end of my work day =/And the parents are still breathing. We don't live in a just society.....You know, I haven't made a ton of great life choices, but I feel like I'm doing OK after reading this horrifying article. Now excuse me while I go Google some cute kitty pics because the thought of a maggot infested baby corpse in a swing is enough for me.Death Penalty for these 2 shites.Were the parents on meth?It’s Iowa, so most likely.The fucked up thing is that there are ppl in this world who have a hard time conceiving kids and would be good parents and there are ppl who don't even want kids popping them out left n right . What type of pc of shit can do this that child must have been screaming bloody murder for days n these fucking junkies ignored it but I guarantee when there drug dealer called they picked that shit up on the first ring I hope they get killed in prison at least the baby is better off now instead of living in hell for years with scumbag junkie parents I'm really starting to lose my faith in humanity. How? Why? My God, this is horrible.paging /u/AnthonyJeselnik1 fuck that's sad :( .... life is horribly unfair Holy fuck... That is beyond horrible. Fuck them, drugs or not... a week went by. This is why we have the death penalty. Look at moms deformed nose.fetal alcohol syndromeGod this is so damn depressing...[deleted]Statistics show that when harm reduction strategies are followed, drugs are decriminalized, and health services for addiction recovery are made widely available, the number of addicts in the community drops, and the deaths due to addiction drops.I know it feels disgusting to you, but we're on the same side. It's about saving lives and families. And little kids too.Their addiction to these substances caused them to not give a shit about their child, it being legal or not would have made no difference in the outcome.I admit that I can't tell you if legalization and harm reduction would have saved this child.I can tell you that legalization and harm reduction will save children's lives in the future, as a net improvement from our current policies.As someone in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction, I am grateful every day that I was lucky enough to be dropped into a nice treatment center. I think often about people who are too poor for good treatment centers, and how many continue to relapse, and I think about if my moral fiber is really superior to theirs.I think it isn't. I could have killed someone just as easily as them.Legalizing and regulating drugs is known to reduce criminal activity as well as enrich the community.People addicted to drugs have a medical condition and they should be helped not shunned. What's your metric for "enrich the community"?    EDIT: It's a genuine question people, for fuck's sake.More tax dollars available, less criminal activity, provide opportunities for those addicted to drugs to come forward and get help.Check out what happened in Portugal when they decriminalized drugs a few years ago.  Colorado is another good example. Thanks for answering.By "drugs" I'm assuming you mean Marijuana since there is no way in hell Colorado legalized Meth, Cocaine, Opium etc...More like executed.That attitude is part of the reason the child in the article is dead. Soooo, congratulations on being part of the problem?  No it's not?The reason the kid is dead is because some drugged up junkies made a choice a while back to get high, descended into addiction and prioritized getting high over their kid.These twats need some SAW torture executiodrugs are legal in iowa?It will. If they're legalized they're easier to regulate and people are less ashamed to seek help. The drugs themselves also are less likely to be contaminated.Not to say that these people aren't god awful monsters for what they did, but if this was an opiate binge, then the issue is not the easy access of drugs but likely the socio-economic and untreated mental health factors that led to the binge/drug abuse. Well now, the redditline seems a bit unclear as to who was rotting in the swing: the child or the parents. Is it "Parents charged in death of infant found rotting in swing", or "Parents of infant found rotting in swing charged in death." Maybe some punctuation would help. "Parents charged in death of infant, found rotting in swing" or, "Parents of infant found rotting in swing, charged in death." Which is it?[removed]Now isn't the time nor is this the place for jokes. Go somewhere else. Where should I go? The merry-go-round with the fetal skeletons or the seesaw with the mutilated bodies of infants?Of course it is the time and most definitely the place for jokes. Do not be a fucking idiot! This isn't the back yard of the next of kin. this is a fucking reddit forum. You lot browse over genocide more easily. This is just one fucking baby.. the world has more.[removed]This is disgusting. You have awful taste.  If this chick is attractive then I'm a young Marlon BrandoWay too cute. I hope she gets probation and help for whatever mental illness or addiction she has. Otherwise, what a waste.What the fuck is wrong with you? It just seems like a waste to have her in jail for a long time, putting her in jail isn't going to bring the kid back. The dude should have known better though so he should do life without parole.Why exactly is the father more culpable than the mother here?  It's trolling.are you saying women are capable of being anything other than victims?!?SEXIST PATRIACHAL PIG!I like that these comments are from CocaineFire and Rehabilitated86. It fits. Thank you for keeping the internet interesting.That doesn't make up for the fact that she's not attractive at all.  I walked into a 7-11 this morning and saw four of this same person at the taquito machine She's not unbelievably attractive but she's cute for sure. Reddit neckbeard incels hate attractive women though because they hate what they can't have. It's still a waste to put her in jail imo.Lmao.  Dude you've gotta be shitting me Oh, hun. You're feeding the trolls. Just walk away.
I need to start a famous people sexual harassment pool at the office.I have Ben Affleck being thrown to the wolves if Justice League flops.He adopted a dog, so it's all good.   http://people.com/pets/ben-affleck-adopts-new-puppy/This is how you do it.Own a bitchHe was already caught and no one cares.so was Weinstein.So was Richardson.$10 on Quentin.He only sexually assaults feet. Here's he thing, if Quentin looked like Harvey Weinstein, Uma Thurman would be all over TV right now talking about how she was harassed by Quenton Tarantino.  I don't mean to say quenton was absolutely a creep, I have no idea, and I'm not trying to belittle Weinstein's actions, I'm just saying that there is a line between flirting and sexual harrassment, and in the 90s, in Hollywood, I can imagine that line would be what the guy looks like.And again, I'm not saying it would be ok for QT to force Uma Thurman to watch him take a shower, I think that he wouldn't have to go to those lengths to try to approach women romantically.Weinstein had this warped view of what he needed to do to get pretty women to sleep with him, especially since no woman wanted anything to do with this big ugly bastard, but he had money and power, and since the dawn of man all you needed to get women was money and power, this has only recently changed, even though those kinds of actions have been totally inappropriate for a long time.Lots of women are still attracted to money and power. The thing is, you can date them- you don't have to sexually harassing and assault them, and trade sex for access to jobs. There is no excuse for behaviour like Weinstein's.Right, no excuse.  I think Weinstein's offensive proclivities were cultivated over time, dealing with beautiful women and trying to figure out ways to seduce them, eventually for him the only thing he thinks works is to grab them and do weird shower things with them and try to beg them to touch his penis, and strange shit like that, because he's this big fat rich and famous guy who feels entitled to treat women like his own personal toys.  I'm sure in some cases there were women who were more than happy to play the role for a while, to engage in the exchange of favors, afterall, it's what Hollywood was built on, disgusting as it is.  Hell, it worked for Trump.And look, I am really not trying to make excuses or victim blame or any of that, I'm just trying to do a walkthrough in the mind of a sexual pervert.  Who knows, maybe the only reason he ever wanted to be rich and famous is so he could get away with all this devious behavior.Yes I think you have a good point. It's useful to understand the mind of people who do shitty things- I mean, some people are psychopaths, but most people who do shitty things are just regular people. They're not monsters- no more than the rest of us. The battle of good and evil isn't our there as much as inside every one of us. I mean what are the things that erode our conscious to such a degree that we would think his behavior is acceptable?There's a lack of respect for the women, if you don't have value in people then you can certainly do terrible things to them, and It's possible that as a big time Hollywood producer for many years he has never respected women.There's his thought that he could get away with it, because he's rich, he had all these important connections all over town, and assumed he could do whatever hedonistic thing he wanted without the public's knowledge, Finally, maybe there is some sort of mental impulse problem that he developed over time, the idea that he should be able to have whatever he wanted because he was rich and famous.What an asshole.You do know that all the women that banged Weinstein did so because they chose to right? None were forced. They were given inappropriate options that shouldn't be allowed and they chose to fuck to improve their career. These women whored themselves out. They aren't victims like Feldman or Haim, or many others were. These were adult women who CHOSE TO FUCK FOR MONEY.Why is everyone ignoring the fact they could have said no? Lena Heady did.&gt;You do know that all the women that banged Weinstein did so because they chose to right? None were forced. Many or most are talking about incidents of sexual harassment and assault, and not intercourse. So you're wrong about "all the women" being choosing to do the things that they endured with him. The ones that did are considered his "ex Girlfriends"it's not sexual harassment if you can just quit and get blacklisted from ever working in your field again, right?!?Tarantino is attractive?You need your head checked if you think good looking men aren’t creeps and only “pretty” women get harassed.No, but good looking men can be creeps and women can be slightly more ok with it, by which I mean consenting.And of course non-pretty women get harassed, but Weinstein had a corral of hollywood actresses to chose from.and both situations are equally inappropriate.You realize if the woman doesn’t think it’s creepy or uncomfortable, it’s her perogative. It’s not about looks. Jesus.I think from the woman's perspective it absolutely is about looks.You hear about Ben Afflack playing grabass all the time on the set but nobody gives a damn.Now should it be about looks?  no, inappropriate behavior is inappropriate.It's just as inexcusable either way, I hope i've made that clear, but nobody is going to run George Clooney up the flagpole for doing some inappropriate sex joke on set where he rubs his penis on some lady.And yeah, that is totally fucking creepy and wrong, and there's no place for that in society, but I can see how it could happen.The only reason "all you needed to get women was money and power" in the past was because women were property.I think that's a little revisionist.You see it everywhere, fat ugly rich guy with a hot young wife.I'm sure he's just so charming.  A real Fairy tale love story I'm sure they have.Well, which is it?  Do women care about looks or do they care about money?  Or do you mean that women are varied and are concerned with a variety of characteristics of their partners?  You know, like people.I'd hate to meet the comic book hero named, Pervpool.Why isn't that a porn site yet?I'd put money on Ted Cruz.Lots of silence regarding Mr. Rodgers, and the bookmakers are intrigued.Jesus christ.I don't think of myself as a suicidal person, but if Mr. Rogers got in to any kind of trouble with little kids or something, I might just have to slit my wrists.My faith in humanity would be forever lost.Bad jokes aside, Fred Rogers was decent, humble, and good human being. It makes quite the contrast to the Weinsteins of this world.TLDR : Women accuse him of groping them, propositioning for kisses, and pressing his boner against them. He admits to fraternizing. He denies pressing his dick against or groping the women.How else do you show a woman you’re interested other than pressing your boner against them?Name checks out. Club her over the head and drag her to your cave. It's not that easy. You gotta rope her in with a good Jakal dance for starters.Have you tried jacking off into a plant?Cocaine is a hell of a drug ...A picture of said boner.It seems to be a trend to deny the more serious allegations but admit to the lesser onesThe trend seems to be false rape accusations tbh famalam.There's an enormous gain potential in #metoo and very little downside or accountability.  The media ofc will report on every single accusation.In reminded of that quote from the Crucible. "Is the accuser always holy now?".Aside from Newsweek they won't report on the Elie Wiesel allegations. Even the most cursory research will tell you that false accusations are less than 10% of reports. Pretty important distinction here.  One of those things makes him a weirdo who thinks that trying to get women to kiss him works outside the universe of romcoms and the other is actually getting sexually aroused by non-consensual encounters.Don’t fish off the company dock lol. Consensual or not, it’s probably going to bite you in the ass at some point.He is the most pandering "journalist" imaginable. If this is true, so glad it may just end his career in the mainstream.These rich old molesters are really making me worry about what my little sisters might have to deal with when they get into the work force.Everyone invest in discrete tape recorders.that's why it's so important that women are speaking out and ending the stigma that this sort of behavior happens only in isolated cases, and men realize that this kind of behavior is unacceptable, period. it's very positive for women and girls, and i'm encouraged by the solidarity women (and non-female allies) are showing in the face of this.If you really want to know ask every female family member you know.  They've all been dealing with this since...forever.And research wiretap laws. There's no "might". Your sisters are going to have to deal with some level of harassment or assault at their jobs. Best thing you can do is teach them to not take that shit and be there for them if something does happen. Or, ya know, they won't. Claiming that this is a 100% occurrence at every single job is well...just kind of dumb and not helpful at all. It's extremely common. Don't be naive. We teach all kids what good and bad touch is, because it turns out some people are perverts. Your logic is that that type of education is "kind of dumb and not helpful". Are you fucking serious? Do you really think not educating men and women would do anyone any good?thats not what they're saying. they're saying 100% of women get harassed **at some point**, not that 100% of jobs harass womenI don't think it's unreasonable to thin kg they will have more then one job in their life time. So it's  a pretty good given it will happen, so they need to know what to do and how to handle it.But so is claiming it doesn't happen in grossly huge amounts (not suggesting that that's what you said).The safer option of the two is to prepare for the worst, not to remain complacent in the interest of middle ground.EDIT: Downvotes don't erase the problemNever said not to prepare or whatever, but it's absolutely toxic to teach young girls that they are going to be sexually assaulted no matter what and only serves to cultivate fear of the opposite sex on both ends: women afraid that all men are inherently sexually violent, and men afraid that all women will interpret any sort of friendly gesture or even just a professional interaction as grounds for having them fired. Again, just toxic."each young girls that they are going to be sexually assaulted "but it is incredibly likely they will be. I don't think you understands the magnitude of this problem.Yeah, that's not the big social problem we need to fix. That's a slight problem for men created by actual instances of assault on women.Women do not generally go out of their way to accuse people of sexual harassment. It's not an epidemic. It's actually stacked heavily toward women being silent, despite the #metoo.And men do not generally go out of their way sexually harass people. So teaching girls that they do is kind of wrong, no? By the way, I stated two social problems, but you chose to completely ignore me mentioning one of them.Look at the statistics on rape and sexual harassment, tell me that girls do not need to be cautious that any man could become sexually violent.If you were a girl and those were your chances, you would be afraid for good reason. That doesn't mean you can't navigate the world, but I'm sorry, dealing with men harassing you is just objectively part of dealing with life as a woman.But no, lets focus on how awful it is for men to have to live in a world where women have really good reason to fear them. That's illegal, unwarranted surveillance of American citizens. It's only legal when NSA does it.Many states have one-party consent laws in terms of recording conversations and such.They will likely be dealing with a much better situation than if it was 50 years ago.Get her [one of these](https://sobtactical.com/store/punchers/).This really sucks.  I once respected this man.  CNN's comments are beyond damning.To be fair, he was very publicly offended by Trump's "pussy" comment.So clearly he's reformed. No other explanation.Edit: Oops, woman number 6 comes froward on record... https://www.thewrap.com/journalist-emily-miller-accuses-mark-halperin-sexual-harassment/“I thought I was the only one, and I blamed myself, and I was embarrassed and I was scared of him,” says MillerLOL. He was one of the [Trump apologists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/26/mark-halperin-accused-of-sexual-harassment-once-said-there-was-nothing-illegal-about-trumps-alleged-groping/?utm_term=.b0801f597625) on that, among many other things.This makes me sort of sad.  I see him occasionally on MSNBC in his contributor role and he always seemed so reasonable, calm and.... nonsexual.  What I'd expect a journalist to be.  yeah he was my favorite commentator on Morning Joe.  Quite sad.  The cynic in me would say that if you want to get rid of someone who you dislike at work or otherwise, accuse them of sexual harassment/assault... hard evidence is optionalWell, he partially admitted doing this. &gt; ccuse them of sexual harassment/assault... hard evidence is optionalWell, if you were in a union, you could push for the union to ensure due process in situations like that. Or you could hire an attorney. You have rights under the law, it's up to you to exercise those rights, especially if you are falsely accused.So is everyone remotely famous now all of a sudden being accused of sexual harassment and being fired/suspended/arrested??? Why is this happening all of a sudden?i assume it has something to do with the self-admitted serial sex offender that got elected, but that's just a guess.these kinds of revelations come in bursts because the women are frequently too scared or ashamed to bring it up on their own. Basically it's easier to say "me too" than it is to be the first one to speak up. women see it happening to other people and it pushes some women to speak up about their harasser, which causes other victims to come forward, and on and on&gt; i assume it has something to do with the self-admitted serial sex offender that got electedSo one good outcome of Trump being elected?Because every women you've ever met in your life has had a sexual harassment encounter. This includes famous people. Because they fucking deserve it. That's why it is happening. Compared to the damage they have done to people's lives, it really isn't justice.Weinstein emboldened some people to come forward, and you can bet that others are just claiming it for sympathyBurn him at the stake and continue the hunt!Hopefully these accusations get him some time in a court room. We need to put the guilty behind bars.Harassment doesn’t carry jail time as a penalty. I doubt we will see much coming from past transgressions in terms of punishment (other than perhaps people having to step down from high level positions), but hopefully an enabling of victims to feel compelled to report sooner. I'm pretty sure pressing you boner against someone can get you some time.Not defending the action at all, but that seems like a really difficult thing to prove in a court of law ...Sexual harassment doesn't get people a ticket to iron city.So he is guilty?  On a baseless accusation.  Hopefully this woman spends some time behind bars when it comes out it is bullshit.  I love that this was going to be what would bring down the pieces of shit that run hollywood but now is just a way for women to destroy their bosses lives while the real perpetrators of horrible shit don't get touched as no one will risk their career.  Fuck all these hoes.I probably could have said it better. I want him to go to court to be proven guilty. Put him behind bars if he is found guilty. Everybody should get a chance to clear their name if not guilty./r/mensrights is leakingTop post on that sub:&gt;A Fan Groped Harry Styles At A Concert &amp;amp; It's Not OKIs this a controversial position?Anybody want to place bets of when Joel Osteen gets outed?There's no reason to expect it of Osteen in particular, unless there are rumors I'm not aware of. There are other preachers on TV I'd be more apt to think of as potential harassers/assaulted I was raped as a kid. I have a pretty good radar for creeps. Osteen is a creep. Will he get outed, who knows. But he is a creep.[Halperin is a friend of Trump](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iB5FKV4yF.PU/v5/-1x-1.jpg). So I'm not surprised.Taking a picture was someone doesn't make your their friends.Google it. They're close personal friends. The picture was just an example.Why don't you Google it for me if you have such damning evidence.He did say Trump didn't do anything illegal by groping womenhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/26/mark-halperin-accused-of-sexual-harassment-once-said-there-was-nothing-illegal-about-trumps-alleged-groping/?utm_term=.b0801f597625I wonder if this man will be burned at the stake like Bill O was. MSNBC is trash, always have been, yet I RARELY see this “news” network lambasted like Fox News is. The Bill O story flooded the front page of this site STILM TO THIS DAY, this MSNBC story will be swept under the rug and never brought up again.Halperin was suspended the day the allegations came out. O'Reilly was allowed to remain for years after allegations.Also worth noting that these allegations concern behavior that occurred while Halperin was with ABC, several years before he was hired by MSNBC. So I'm not even sure why they are attacking MSNBC, they aren't involved (at the moment) in any way other than being his current employer.Have you ever considered the fact that Bill O'Reilly is like 50x more famous than Mark Halperin? &gt; Have you ever considered the fact that Bill O'Reilly is like 50x more famous than Mark Halperin? I had no idea our legal system punished people based on the amount of fame they have.Could you point out where in the Constitution it says that?OP wasn't talking about the legal consequences each suffered, but the media coverage of the scandal each received.Nobody knows who Mark Halperin is. He's not going to get much coverage. He doesn't even have his own show on MSNBC, he just appears once in a while as a panelist.&gt; He's not going to get much coveragei guarantee you conservatives will be chanting his name as a mantra any time a conservative gets outed as a sex fiend, because they need to make it look like "both sides do it" SOMEHOW!&gt; He doesn't even have his own show on MSNBC,I guess I think anyone in journalism who is abusing other people sexually should be punished and the light shone on them equally.Just because someone is more famous doesn't mean they should get hit harder, that's ludicrous.When somebody super famous with a household name like Bill O'Reilly gets hit with sexual harassment allegations, it's going to be a big deal. If someone accused me of sexual harassment, you'd never hear about it and it wouldn't even make the papers, because I'm not famous. I'm sorry you don't like that but that's the way it is. I wouldn't suffer fewer legal consequences, but nobody is going to give a fuck if some guy they never heard of gets accused of sexual harassment, because that happens to hundreds of random people every day.It would be the same deal if Bill O'Reilly and Mark Halperin murdered somebody. More people would write about and want to read about what O'Reilly did.Halperin is a Republican by the way and a friend of Trump, so don't act like it's liberals protecting their own or something by them not making a media circus out of this. He's just really non-famous.&gt; Halperin is a Republican by the way and a friend of Trumphttp://dailycaller.com/2017/10/26/throwback-thursday-halperin-lectures-what-could-be-worse-than-access-hollywood-tape/Uh....yeah he's no friend of Trump.  Where do you people get this shit?Linking dailycaller as a source is fucking retarded and you should know better.A tucker carlson gossip ragIt's all about ratings, because that drives your ad revenue.  You get more viewers if you're doing a story on O'Reilly than on Halperin.  I can't understand why that isn't obvious.What? I'm not talking about the legal system. Nobody was. Wow, you really have a tenuous grip on reality.  The reason why you don't see MSNBC lambasted like Fox News is:1) Fox's sexual harrassment problems seem to be much more endemic.2) They took a long time to deal with it once it came to light (and that's a general pattern not just for sexual harassment).3) They get called out regularly just for doing a shitty job.  I recall a survey among audiences on their actual knowledge of current events and as it turned out Jon Stewart's the Daily Show came out on top and Fox came out below people who didn't watch any news.In any event, conservatives have no credibility with sexual harassment given that you knowingly elected a person who admitted sexual harassment/assault with multiple accusations against him as President of the fucking United States!  Shoo!Ultimately only one news network has fought in court for the right to lie on TV and it's Fox News.It's one of the biggest stories of the week. It was even covered on Morning Joe. Take off your tin foil hat and breathe.Check water supply.Mercury contamination indicated.Somehow conservatives will use this to point fingers at liberals and say that they allow sexual abuse, but organizations like Fox should really be taking notes because they tend not to do anything when their employees are accused until word gets out or they stay silent until a settlement is reachedLol kinda how liberals cant even comment about MSNBC reporter without mentioning conservatives or fox news...Barely any comments in here mentioning Fox News...He's a toad just like his buddy tRump.[deleted]They weren't just accused, evidence was presented that showed the misconduct was even worse.Or Donald Trump!The Dog's Chosen strike again.Yep/ It's not like Republicans ever got caught doing worse things like molesting/raping children like say hastert and foley or had en entire news network just full of powerful men raping and sexually harassing women at all levels of the organization from the top down for decades like fox news.He's being anti-Semitic.  Nothing to do with Dem vs. Rep.Well that somewhat explains his love for Trump.https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2016/10/26/mark-halperin-s-truly-laughable-interview-donald-trump/214143https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/26/mark-halperin-accused-of-sexual-harassment-once-said-there-was-nothing-illegal-about-trumps-alleged-groping/?utm_term=.b0801f597625Meanwhile, we'll ignore Bill Clinton's sordid and rapey past. Maybe this isn't a partisan issue, maybe this is a societal issue, because it seems that people like to give rapists and pervs power. Wonder why? Could it be because that rape and sexual abuse are endemic in our culture? Naw, why think about it when you can just turn it into political propaganda.But MUH right wingers! I mean, if he'd have worked for fox, [it would have taken like 13 more years and a repeat offense to get him actually fired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bill-oreilly-settled-sixth-sexual-harassment-claim-for-32-million/2017/10/21/ff34b24c-b68c-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html).You’ll notice how both the left and the right will condemn this guy’s behavior. When the people on Fox were accused, the right called it a witch hunt and an attack on the conservative agenda.I'm not really sure which of these responses to the sexual harrasment scandals response is worse.Fox News: victim blaming/character defamationHollywood: patronizining/ complicityReally sort of torn at this point.
Always kills me.. somehow the aliens can master interstellar travel, cross vast distances between galaxies, but are repeatedly thwarted by John Edmonds, the ranch owner.#lol!"In 1954, then-President Dwight Eisenhower made a pact with three species of aliens... In exchange for alien technology, Eisenhower allegedly gave aliens permission to abduct some cattle and a limited number of human beings" - [Source](https://www.theepochtimes.com/did-the-us-government-make-a-pact-with-aliens-to-get-technology_681334.html)Part of the deal is not harming humans, based on the treaty.Why would a species capable of interstellar travel need our permission and a trade agreement to take cattle and people? Would we really be able to stop them? And why couldn't they just take some and breed them their selves?Because they aren't savages and don't want to violate our basic human rights?  I mean, aside from the shoving things in our asses. They don't want to violate our basic human rights but still kidnap and experiment on us?But they filled out all the proper paperwork first. Seriously, it isn't that hard to understand... It's called a **contract**, people! They are **legally binding**!the aliens must have one hell of a lawyer.Nah, they've just watched all our porn and think that ass play is equivalent to a heartfelt greeting.Well, you only literally feel it in your chest if you shop at Bad Dragon.They get the old farmer's wife. We get stealth tech. Who has the better lawyer.dude you seen the farmer's wife though?T.H.I.C.CMust be the alien race that the Germans came from.   /s(also, I am [German](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6329336714527670272), I can make this joke)Anyone can joke about the Germans, it's in the Treaty of Versailles.I want a turn! Um... you guys... uh... build really nice cars... yeah... gonna need aloe for that burn...So you have a little German in ya?In triplicate. The galaxy guide lines are kinda loose on that oneThou shalt not kill ^^but ^^butt ^^stuff ^^is ^^okButt stuff is always okay. Not after Taco Tuesday.Thirsty Thursday ok? And what's the deal with shoving things in our asses all about?Are they all budding gastroenterologist s? Or are they stealing our gut biomes for science?Nah, it's just a simple insertion fetish. Wait...Whaaaaa!!!? An *insertion* fetish!? Never heard of that one,but I'll be looking it up. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tZar4wRP40) should answer your questions. And it did...Why thank you!Now I understand.You'd think if they were concerned with that, they'd take people who want to be taken. I'm sure there are people who would line up to volunteer.Yeah, but those kinds of people are kooks.They saw Independence Day and the countless other movies where mankind can kick literally any aliens ass. They're scared of us, so don't tell them Movies are fake.They could fix the code where it makes their mothership explode, but their devs are lazy. Username: mothershipPassword: adminwhat could go wrong?What are the odds that two species from completely different planets and with a completely different biology, culture and history both invested the same language and used admin as the default password! Poor aliens. See: the DC universe. All the Kryptonians and some other alien races speak English for some reason.Yes, and if the President even came to an agreement on that why would they go out into the public and cause a ruckus abducting farmers? Couldn't the CIA just hand over a few "disappeared" people from time to time.Well I mean, if a species becomes capable of interstellar travel, the only reasons they would come to Earth would be for scientific study or cultural exchange. Or they found out Earth girls are easy. Or to harvest our bodies to power their ships. Come on, use your imagination!Wouldn't pretty much anything make a better battery than a human body? Or to harvest our resourcesCompared to the asteroid belts and solar output the earth has no resources to speak of.Really? The *only* reasons?You know, I could kind of understand humans, but why cattle...?have you ever ate a steak before? they are kind of fantastic.Wouldn't it be funny if beef was like an interstellar delicacy that doesn't exist anywhere else. or instead of surf and turf it's like man and turfMaybe humans are really good at war, and aliens have never thought about murdering before.  Because we do have the power to stop them.  We're not weaklings, Targeted attacks would succeed against them.  They have better tech, but there aren't that many of them and they do have vulnerabilities.Lawful evilSo, I don't believe any of this based on a few people saying it is true, but just to play devil's advocate...If there was an interstellar species then their probably would be many. They would probably have something like the geneva accords to establish interstellar law. Those accords might require treaties with local governments on planets where you want to do whatever the hell they want to do.The Shadow Proclamation?Is that a thing? I'm not familiar. But in general, I think that intelligent entities will tend to become more and more similar - mentally and socially speaking - as we evolve. Any aliens that exist have to deal with the same existential realities as us humans. I think this means we can imagine what sorts of legal structures they may develop.It’s a Doctor Who thing.I'm always open to understandable evidence, but they wouldn't need any more humans after at least the first 100 males or females, they would just breed them, not to mention artificial wombs. Then it came to several different species of aliens apparently craving the delicacy of human beings as "a bag of food" for some unknown evolutionary reasons.Then the straw which broke the camel's back is that they violated the treaty which led to a "war". There is no fucking war, everyone who reads this with a straight face has been watching too many sci-fi movies and never thinking for a second, much less attending a science class. 9 different Type 2 interstellar civilizations have enough energy to atomize the entire planet with a flick of their finger. And enough technical knowledge to paralyze every single human with nanonbots or biological weapons within the hour should they want them alive for any reason. What if there is something akin to a space UN though, and destroying a monkey planet with no way to protect itself would be similar to nuking the Congo cuz they won't do x. Bringing intergalactic sanctions and possibly war with other species. Just spit ballin here.No kidding... the only way a war is even feasible is if both parties have the chance of inflicting damage on each other.  The chance of the 1950s America being able to put a dent against an interstellar traveler?  Zilch.I’d say our chances would still suck even now... deliveries of payloads into space are slow.  If we are getting close to blowing up our own nukes in transit then what would an advanced civilization worry aboutAlso, Eisenhower was not a dumb man.&gt;He said the aliens plan to take over Earth by 2029 and he called on the government to tell citizens what it knows.RemindMe! 12 years "Buy bread and milk, alien invasion"Start investing in canned foods and shotguns.Finally someone with some real information in this thread.That's a bunch of bologna.Or is it? (Que X-Files theme song)[Queue or Cue](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-correct-queue-the-music-or-cue-the-music-and-why)Maybe /u/DogButtTouchinMyButt was asking "What X-Files theme song"?¿Que musica en los archivosdel X, señor?Do ^^do ^do ^^do ^^^do ^^^^doThose would be the aliens in the secret base in [Dulce](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/roadtrippers/that-time-subterranean-al_b_5182945.html), New Mexico.  There are some pretty elaborate stories about them from [Phillip Schneider](https://www.theepochtimes.com/alien-human-battle-of-1979-in-new-mexico-alleged-eye-witness-report_607504.html) and [Thomas Costello](http://www.reptoids.com/Vault/ArticleClassics/dulceTEChistory.htm).  The rabbit hole goes pretty deep, although follow up investigations have not turned up any corroborating evidence.I'm fairly confident that if the government had contact and a secret pact with aliens that by now we would have seen Trump on TV saying something like "Listen folks I have one of the greatest brains, good genes, the president of the aliens, Zorblax, supported me right from the beginning by the way, head guy, huge head on him, said I have the best brain.  Funny little guy, looks a little like this * *spasms uncontrollably* *, anyway folks, Zorblax said that my victory over crooked hillary was the biggest victory in the history of the galaxy, maybe the whole universe.  But this deal that Obama made with him for our cattle and uranium, just terrible, we're gonna have the best alien deals folks..."Lol apparently he said the aliens violated the treaty by taking more humans then agreed upon and we have been fighting a war with them ever since. They plan to take over earth by 2029.LololI'm pretty sure by then they won't want it anymoreRecently read a short sci-fi story that had an interesting idea at it's core- that interstellar 'warp' travel is extremely easy to accomplish. So easy, in fact that people who have barely discovered Steel can do it.  But for some reason, we Earthlings never found it.So, the story opens with a bunch of, well, basically Roman Legionnaires (aliens, but with that level of technology- torches for light, spears for weapons, and I think they just barely discovered gunpowder) traveling to, and landing on, Earth... and getting trounced by automatic weapons and airplanes, etc.THAT  is about the only scenario that I can see where our technology will be superior to that of an interstellar-traveling civilization.The Road Not Taken. Great short story. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken_(short_story)The Road Not Taken by Harry Turtledove.  Good story.  You should enjoy The Salvation Wars. The Legions of Hell invade, for the first time since the Bronze Age, Iraq in 2003 at just about the time America has taken the country. I read that too.  Loved it.Yeah that story was bad ass. Turns out interstellar travel is stupid easy so they're traveling the stars by candle light lol. Tbh, it could very well be that these beings don't even know what aggression is, let alone fighting. We don't know anything!&gt; could very well be that these beings don't even know what aggression is, let alone fighting. I'd say the chances that a advanced race  - who has mastered interstellar travel - doesn't somehow know to defend themselves from potential threats to be zero.zero. ;)edit: Even the most basic life forms on Earth know how to defend themselves from potential threats. Such as fungus.Could like the buggers in the Ender's Saga - they didn't know killing individual humans was bad because they were a hive mind collective (where killing the drones was as trivial as clipping nails is to us). So it's not that they completely lack understanding of aggression, it's that the parameters of that understanding are different. Nah, they've evolved beyond such base savagery, maaann.But on earth life is competitive. Kill or be killed. Eat or be eaten. Maybe their planet's form of life is more cooperative. Like communism to our capitalism. Our own interstellar Ruskies. I don't think evolution would even work without competition. Well it could, it would just be different. But yeah, odds are any ecosystem will be a competitive one. https://eyeofmidas.com/scifi/Turtledove_RoadNotTaken.pdfchances may not be as slim as you think. Wel,maybe there are Galactic rules and they are walking a thin line!I like the idea that the aliens who visit us are the most "rural" aliens out there.  So cow/human abduction is the equivalent of "hold my beer and let me get in this lion cage".Well, from a risk perspective, it'd be the safest place. When NASA was choosing locations to place Curiosity, I doubt any of the planners spoke up and said "Hey, let's land it on the side of that mountain". Ghost Adventures did an episode on this property not too long ago. Bat-shit crazy goodness.Masters of Time space, but not so much on hammers or clothing.Humans are unique in the local galaxy in that they are one of the only technological species that seems to have no qualms about killing members of their own species or of others.In fact, some of humans even seem to "enjoy" the murder of their own, with this enjoyment becoming more apparent when the victim is of a differing species or race.I feel like an idiot thinking he meant illegal Mexicans. Of course it would be space aliens.Private Vasquez: Look, man. I only need to know one thing: where they are.Private Drake: Go, Vasquez. Kick ass.Private Vasquez: Anytime, anywhere, man!Private Hudson: Right, right. Somebody said "alien" she thought they said "illegal alien" and signed up!Private Vasquez: Fuck you, man!Private Hudson: Anytime, anywhereI think there'd be a problem if the guy had dozens of corpses of illegal immigrants scattered about his property. It's Arizona. Pretty soon they reward ranchers for that.Nah, ICE would just help him dispose of them so they didn't have to be bothered with the paperwork.Photo of dried up blood but no photos of the alien artifact he found or of the many aliens he killed. Weird, huh? Good way to upsell his property...If you look at his facebook, you can see that this guy is a nutter.  I wouldn't be surprised if the guy is schizophrenic First thought was she was cheating and he is gullible. -(man hears strange noises coming from his barn and investigates)-Honey why are you sweaty and out of breathe? -uh...aliens...they tried to take me.Meanwhile the stableboy sneaks away&gt;With five bedrooms, four baths and nearly 3,500 square feet of living space, a ranch property just about an hour west of Phoenix has everything you could ever ask for in an Arizona home: a pool, lots of acreage, a gated entry for privacy, and a possible portal to another universe.But honey! It's got a portal to another universe! Pleaaaase!I don't know...  Is the portal to another universe a nice tasteful blue, or green?  Or is it one of those gross swirly toilet-bowl things?  I mean, just think what the *neighbors* would think!Ah it's probably just one of those cheap ones made in China or something. If it even works it probably takes you to the wrong universe.The best portals are blue *and* swirly.its a portal to another dimension Beth, not a oversized bird fountain. I'll just *burp* build a shed over it or something.Only 5 million! What a steal!Have you looked at the school district scores?  Sometimes I don’t understand youThis guy is delusional if he thinks he is going to get anywhere near $5 million he is asking.  Land out between Rainbow Valley and Buckeye isn't particularly valuable. (10,000 to 100,000 per acre depending on how developed it is)  Even with a fully up and running horse farm, this property hasn't been over a million dollars on any real estate valuation website until 2016, and even then it was just a blip because he had listed it for 3 million.  He has been constantly listing and delisting this home from the past 10 years and keeps consistently asking more than triple it's perceived value when looking at comparable properties in the area.  He has been pushing the news to report craziness like this to help justify his price for at least 10 years.  He is a known nut job, but good luck selling that house.I think delusional might be a foregone conclusion here...I imagine his reason for selling will be another man's reason for buying!The guy needs a shrink, not media attention. Seriously. He has photographic evidence of everything except, y'know, proof. He may be smart considering he may get a premium for selling the ranch because of the attention.&gt;In one particular photo, a samurai sword lays in a pool of what appears to be dried blood. The blood allegedly belonging to an alien he says he killed on March 13, 2017. In his own comment on the photo, Edmonds claims he has slain over a dozen extraterrestrials on his property.Everyone knows you don't take a samurai sword to an alien fight.Does anyone else find people who even have samurai swords to be less trustworthy than people who don't?I find scimitar owners to be less trustworthy in general.*I* don't have a Samurai Sword....Counterpoint: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYfUvW_3C3UI would be more interested to see if there's any missing person reports nearby.Well, over a dozen extraterrestrials say otherwise...Pfft. Selling the house won't help. His wife has obviously been tagged by the aliens and they'll just follow the signal to wherever they move. High asking price not bringing in any buyers?  Just make up stories about alien attacks and voila, instant free advertising to help sell your ranch.My first thought exactly, genius. In fairness that does sound like a pretty solid reason to try and sell one's ranch. After 20 years...Ranchers are stubborn. And aliens are crafty. Good luck trying to sell the ranch for $5 mil...now the whole world knows the place is infested with malevolent ETs...you know how much it costs, to tent &amp; fumigate a property that big?An infestation of aliens is going to bring the price of the property down.Selling the ranch so he can afford the funny farm.So he slayed a bunch of aliens, took pretty good pictures of the sword and blood....but no pictures of the aliens themselves.  His story is sooo believable.  Obviously he's trying to make some shit up in hopes to increase the price of the ranch.This is what happens when Scooby and The Gang don't show up to solve the mystery.He also said the aliens tried to abduct his wife.“They actually levitated her out of the bed in the master chamber and carried her into the parking lot and tried to draw her up into the craft,” he said. ....      Was she too fat or something? Unless one is playing bondage or some other rôle-playing games, anyone who calls their bedroom the "master chamber" is playing with an incomplete deck of cards.And maybe even missing a 12-sided dice.Why is this man's crazy considered newsworthy?The entertainment value of the headline is worth it.And therein lies the problem: entertainment not news.Because now he's gonna sell it a shit ton quicker. Anyone care to guess who this guy voted for?He said aliens, i thought he meant illegal aliensSo you signed up?Have you ever been mistaken for a man before?You ever been to a Turkish prison?Gee what can we do to boost visibility of this property we're selling?That is excellent marketing both aimed at ufo fans and people who want their wife kidnapped.I've become so jaded about the news that I thought that this was a story about immigrants when I clicked on it.&gt;Edmonds claims he has slain over a dozen extraterrestrials on his propertyAnd yet not a single photo of one. How convincing.1. Own, and live on, a shitty ranch in the middle of a desert. 2. Decide to move, but no buyers because shitty ranch is in the fucking desert.3. Create UFO hoax by putting bullshit pictures and posts on Fakebook. 4. Ranch gets international attention from TV shows that investigate bullshit and people that believe it.5. Profit.6. Sell house and move.In Arizona, doesn't alien mean Mexican?I cannot help but wonder if anal probing was involved here!Well, of course there was. If you had the power of interstellar travel, wouldn't you cruise the universe looking for people to give colonoscopies to?Without DNA testing on the blood Im gonna call BS and close that chrome tabOn his facebook, he claimed he sent 'fluid samples' in for testing previously.  But the lab technician and his wife were killed.  The guy is off his rocker.What I don't get is why aliens can cross the infinite reaches of space and yet, only are able to abduct people out in the middle of nowhere? Like E.T. is afraid to go to Brooklyn, or Seattle or something...Probably would be easily seen is my guess. I'll give him a lifetime supply of tinfoil hate for it.I genuinely thought this was a story about illegal immigrant gangs attempting a kidnapping based of the title. Apparently I've lost my sense of imagination some time ago.Great this Asshole just started a galactic war. BUCKLE UP EVERYONE The Gang needs to climb into the Mystery Machine and solve this. Lies! He's moving because he had to do battle and got a scar. The levitating almost-abduction didn't make any difference.I also notice we didn't hear from the wife. She's probably an alien.Arizona man, fighter of the Florida man.I'm very disappointed with the lack of Majora's Mask references in this comment section. Eh, haven't played it yet. Still waiting for my copy to show up in the mail with the $99 GameCube bundle I just got from gamestop.sounds like someone doesn't like analThese strange happenings occur on a regular basis, and yet he never bothered to install a security cam, or even catch a real pic of one with his phone.  Ok.I was fine when they abducted me. I mean the probing was a lot like what I imagine butt sex would be like, but since these fellows said they were aliens it wasn't homo. homo meaning "man"  of course and aliens aren't men. And the butt sex, I mean probing, wasn't all that horrible comparably. And afterwards, they took me right back home and set me on my front stoop. Nice enough fellows over all. But then they went and abducted the missus and that was just a bridge too far. A bridge too far obviously.I'll give him about tree-fiddy!He does have a point with that last line about manifesting one's energy.The latest books allegedly dictated by the ETs say that abductees and 'experiencers' are agreeing on some level to what happens to them and the aliens with their 5+ dimensional focus don't understand just how compartmentalized we are in our limited psyche of 3 &amp; 4 dimensions.I recommend the book called Talking To Extraterrestrials or another recent one entitled *Called* for folks wanting more than just the standard internet discourse and the disappointing but predictable meme of "ET = crazy"Fuck the JFK files, I wanna know about the ayyy'sObviously one of the folks at Trump's AZ rally.He should turn the place into an attractionMy guess is they no longer want to live there for whatever reason and they can’t get much $ for the property so they are trying to create some interest. Creative way to advertise property for sale.As a sales pitch, this is actually pretty inspired.  He probably just wants a condo in town.Want to see alien spacecraft?  Find military grade Nightvision goggles.  Oh boy, we have visitors!  Is our government allowing aliens to abduct people in exchange for exotic technologies, hmm?I'll give him ten Altarian Diamonds for it.*looks at my wife* Uhh I'll take it!keep the ranch, let them take the wife
The 0-7 49ers?The failing San Francisco 49ers.0-8 when Wentz and Philly gets through with them.So to be clear here the team that absolutely abhors the government and believes it is out to kill all of them wants to get rid of one of only two things protecting them from said gov't?Wait, the liberals hate the government? police, military, you know, the people that wouldn't have their guns taken away.That's the dumbest thing I've read all day.Nah I think you got him beat.Hurr durr ma guns pretect me from the gubmint.If you think guns can protect you from modern governments then you are mistaken, and should reexamine your view on the subject.Lol. The insurgencies in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan all seem to disagree with you. For going on 17 years in some cases now actually.......So you think that if the insurgents are annoying enough that the USA will pick up and leave the USA? Yea, turns out your examples are not comparable to the issue at hand. The US government isn't going to cut its losses and leave their own country because you are annoying them.The only way to beat the government of a country by military means is to actually beat it, not just not get beaten by it. If you fight for a thousand years and don't get killed, then all that means is that the government is still winning for a thousand years.Lol. Buddy, iv fought them. It takes weapons and commitment. That's about it.  You have no idea how problematic one dude with a rifle and some home made explosives can be. Governments run on money. Insurgent movements run on ideology. And having been on the other end of the drone/tank/howitzer, trust me when I say you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  I hope it never comes to that.  But to say it can't happen is ignorant. And to think that it could never happen here is naive. So have I buddy, problematic doesn't make any difference to the government in their own country. Problematic does not a victory make.But you go back to thinking that not dying is the same as winning against a military. Oh?  And the US, the biggest baddest military in the world has been defeated by rag tag untrained fighters in:* Vietnam* Korea* Iraq* Afghanistan All the planes all the bombs all the drones are useless.  All it takes is time, persistence, and firearms to fight off well trained armies.   Casualties will be immense, but victory will never be achieved.So do go on, tell me about how guns won't protect us from powerful armies.  Ask Russia how it did in Afghanistan.  The examples are endless.  You are objectively wrong.It's rare for me to see replies when this is brought up.Insurgency works really well when it comes to annoying invaders and making it a pain in the ass politically to occupy. You're not going to annoy your own government so bad by popping out of the bushes and shooting at their armored conveys that the person in charge of the most lopsided military advantage in history is going to give up and flee in exile. &gt; You're not going to annoy your own government so bad by popping out of the bushes and shooting at their armored conveysPocket sand is my weapon of choice.LolNo, the military was fine. The country was beaten in the above. The military had 0 issues in anything except vietnam, and they were not rag tag untrained fighters. Perhaps you should learn what you are talking about.&gt; All the planes all the bombs all the drones are useless.No, they will be the single largest casualty producing weapons. &gt;  All it takes is time, persistence, and firearms to fight off well trained armiesNo, it is not. You are completely wrong. You can use those to annoy armies, but you literally are incapable of defeating them. The invading country literally owning your country for a decade then leaving because they don't want to be there is not a military victory, its a political one. But guess what? The USA isn't going to pull out of the USA. You have no possible way to win. You will die like a fool, and will accomplish nothing but a little down tick in the economy, and annoying real soldiers with annoying terrorist style attacks and ambushes.&gt; Casualties will be immense, but victory will never be achieved.Are you serious? Victory is the governments starting position. They win as long as they remain in power. You have no way to remove them from power. They win while you fart around playing rambo and getting killed by real soldiers.&gt; The examples are endless.Please show me an example of a guerilla force fighting and winning against a modern military in the military's own country. A single one. Because your Afghanistan example is straight up retarded. That's like getting the shit kicked out of you in an alley then claiming victory because your mugger went home to spend your money when they got bored of watching you try and bite their boots.&gt;  You are objectively wrong.You have shown that you have no idea what you are talking about, are objectively wrong about your examples themselves, and are using examples that are unrelated to the current issue. You are the reason real soldiers look at rednecks and militia wannabes and see nothing but a loud dead man waiting to happen. Are you familiar with like any armed conflict ever?Are you familiar with the concept of aircraft, armor, artillery, military, naval craft, and any other part of modern warfare? But no, go ahead and believe that your .22 LR is going to stop a dozen Abrams, fighter jets, and pinpoint 155.Except, all that equipment is operated by the military, not the government, and the military swears it's oaths to uphold the Constitution, not to obey the civilian government. In the incredibly unlikely event a segment of government acquires enough power to act openly against the civilian population, and the military honors their oaths, those weapons would be used to remove the offending government and restore Constitutional order. If the military does not honor it's oaths, all bets are off, all laws mean nothing, and it's every desperate soul for themselves; in all-out chaos, would you rather take your chances with an AR, or a rock on stick?&gt; Except, all that equipment is operated by the military, not the government, and the military swears it's oaths to uphold the Constitution, not to obey the civilian government. Actually, they serve the government, because they are controled by the president and congress. They swear an oath to protect the constitution from enemies, that doesn't mean they don't obey the government. You think the military just decided to go to afghanistan with no input from the civilian government? They are not seperate entities.Also, they literally swear to obey the civilian government. &gt; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The president, and the UCMJ are the executive branch and legislative branch respectively.&gt; In the incredibly unlikely event a segment of government acquires enough power to act openly against the civilian population, and the military honors their oaths, those weapons would be used to remove the offending government and restore Constitutional order.So you are saying that if the government tried to do something wrong they couldn't because the government would stop them. Yea, thats kinda the point in distrobution of power in our government, but your little 22LR didn't help a damn bit did it?&gt; If the military does not honor it's oaths, all bets are off, all laws mean nothing, and it's every desperate soul for themselves; in all-out chaos, would you rather take your chances with an AR, or a rock on stick?Except no it won't, thats crazy and is not how it works. The whole population doesn't spontaniously go full anarchy. It is a small part of the population that takes up arms, and most others do nothing. Thats the only way it can work. If a majority had already reached the point they would take up arms, they would have already changed it politically, since that's how our government works. So you will have a small percentage of people fighting as insurgents with shit weapons, and real soldiers killing them in droves, and a majority of people just living their lives. Which means that once again, your 22LR didn't help.And if you think we should all surrender the means to resist oppression and tyranny simply because the potential tyrants have bigger guns, *you* should reexamine your view on the subject.You don't have the means to resist, that's the point. You are literally arguing for something that doesn't exist. Its like refusing to give up your cure for cancer, when your cure doesn't actually work, and constantly kills people. I fully support having guns, because they are fun and are good for self defense. But the whole "protect against the government" is simply not a valid reason anymore.Resistance is offered by any means necessary; even if the oppressors have tanks and all you have are rocks, you still resist. Countless groups throughout history have effectively resisted better equipped and better organized forces, and surrendering the best tool you have to do that with simply because the opposition has better is ridiculous, and quite frankly, stupid and cowardly.&gt; Its like refusing to give up your cure for cancer, when your cure doesn't actually work, and constantly kills people. When you convince the government, military, law enforcement, and criminal organizations to surrender their ineffective "cure", the rest of us will consider it; until then, we have as much need for the "cure" as they do.&gt; But the whole "protect against the government" is simply not a valid reason anymore.It's called "deterrence", it is a strategy employed by every nation in the world. The simple truth is, it is easier to conquer/control an unarmed, defenseless adversary than it is to do so to an armed one. Whether great or small, all resistance is costly in resources and time, and the more time and resources spent combating resistance, the less than can be expended to cement power. And the more indiscriminate and violent the response to resistance, the more people are driven to resist. Seriously, ask the people of Syria how well not being armed works out when your government decides to gas a few towns to ensure it's power, or the people of China, or North Korea, or Egypt, or Russia, or the Philippines...I could go on, but you should be getting the idea by now.&gt; Resistance is offered by any means necessary; even if the oppressors have tanks and all you have are rocks, you still resist.Cool. Not the issue.&gt; Countless groups throughout history have effectively resisted better equipped and better organized forces, and surrendering the best tool you have to do that with simply because the opposition has better is ridiculous, and quite frankly, stupid and cowardly.Cool, not the issue. Also, fuck you too I guess?&gt; When you convince the government, military, law enforcement, and criminal organizations to surrender their ineffective "cure", the rest of us will consider it; until then, we have as much need for the "cure" as they do.No, their cure actually works. Tanks, rifles, machineguns, artillery, and aircraft win against just rifles. That is not up for debate.&gt; It's called "deterrence", it is a strategy employed by every nation in the world.Deterrence has to actually be a threat though. If it isn't a threat then it doesn't deter anything.&gt; The simple truth is, it is easier to conquer/control an unarmed, defenseless adversary than it is to do so to an armed one. Cool. But dead and annoying isn't really different than dead easily. You still arnt going to win, which is all I am saying.&gt; Whether great or small, all resistance is costly in resources and time, and the more time and resources spent combating resistance, the less than can be expended to cement power.Sure. But some 22LR isn't enough of a difference to effectively cripple the government. It just isn't.&gt; And the more indiscriminate and violent the response to resistance, the more people are driven to resist.I mean, not really. Thats very situational. The more indiscriminate and unjust the more resistance, but more force doesn't really change things much. &gt; Seriously, ask the people of Syria how well not being armed works out when your government decides to gas a few towns to ensure it's powerO, you mean the people that had way more than rifles, had training and equipment from other military's, direct logistics support from other countries, and still couldn't beat a weak military? You literally showed that rifles are not enough to defeat a weak military, let alone a strong one. You are proving my point for me.Look, you are not understanding this point and it is flying over your head. I am not saying that you shouldn't resist or something. I am saying that a rifle will not make a big enough difference to beat the government of the USA. That is all. And it is not enough. That is just facts. Various insurgents and terrorist groups around the world, throughout history would disagree with you.While we do have top notch troops and equipment, they are ultimately people, not everyone one of them will turn against the people if the government we're to go tyrannical. You also have a heavily be armed populace, in territory they know by heart. Those things, coupled with the fact that the government would want to put down an insurrection, not level a city would make it very hard for the government to stamp out an organized resistance at home.&gt; Various insurgents and terrorist groups around the world, throughout history would disagree with you.Please cite a group that has defeated a modern military in that military's own country.&gt; While we do have top notch troops and equipment, they are ultimately people, not everyone one of them will turn against the people if the government we're to go tyrannical.They don't need too. Manpower is not a concern with the modern military, they can recruit more people easier than citizens can build fighter jets and tanks.&gt; You also have a heavily be armed populace, in territory they know by heart.Lol, its not heavily armed by military standards. Rifles and handguns are literally the weakest weapons a soldier expects to face. And no, they don't know the territory by heart. I guarantee a soldier with a precision map, down to the inch GPS systems, and real time aerial feeds on demand with on call local guides will know the terrain better than some Podunk hillbilly that likely only knows a mile or two around his house, and most people don't even know that. &gt; Those things, coupled with the fact that the government would want to put down an insurrection, not level a city would make it very hard for the government to stamp out an organized resistance at home.They dont need to though. People always say that the government can't kill every insurgent, but they have no need to do so. They are winning as long as they control everything important. Not dying is not victory, it is just not dying. the government doesn't give a fuck about losing the occasional soldier and killing a few hundred insurgents every couple days. It does nothing to harm them. In fact, depending on the government it helps them maintain control over the other people that are more worried about some jackass insurgent accidentally blowing their head off than they are about the government taking their guns.Basically, yes, insurgents could survive indefinitely. However that does not make them victors at all, the government isn't going to fall unless the insurgency is so large that they can't maintain control over a majority of the populace, and if the insurrection is that large, then the government would have been changed politically instead of via violent revolution long before this came about.  &gt;&gt; Various insurgents and terrorist groups around the world, throughout history would disagree with you.&gt;&gt;Please cite a group that has defeated a modern military in that military's own country.The last Egyptian uprising in 2011, I believe. While they didn't defeat the military, the did end up getting rid of Mubarak and having a large change in the government. A victory no?&gt;&gt; While we do have top notch troops and equipment, they are ultimately people, not everyone one of them will turn against the people if the government we're to go tyrannical.&gt;&gt;They don't need too. Manpower is not a concern with the modern military, they can recruit more people easier than citizens can build fighter jets and tanks.If you have large numbers of officers and enlisted joining the insurgents, you don't think that will have not only a demoralizing effect on the remaining troops, but a diminished recruitment pool?&gt;&gt; You also have a heavily be armed populace, in territory they know by heart.&gt;&gt;Lol, its not heavily armed by military standards. Rifles and handguns are literally the weakest weapons a soldier expects to face. And no, they don't know the territory by heart.

One, your statement fails to consider current and past service members. Two, you are looking at this like the military is just going to roll in like back in WW2, and carpet bomb the hell out of the place. You think the people in Little Town are just going to sell out the local "Freedom fighters"?&gt;&gt;&gt; Those things, coupled with the fact that the government would want to put down an insurrection, not level a city would make it very hard for the government to stamp out an organized resistance at home.&gt;&gt;They dont need to though.

You make a strong point, and there are many that would "trade liberty for security", but this country can also be an extremely violent and unstable mess when provoked enough. The government will always have to play by the rules, even in this made up scenario because of politics,  can't be seen as tyrannical even if you are. The internet is good for something I guess. But insurgents only have to not piss off the majority of the people, giving them an advantage of sorts.&gt; The last Egyptian uprising in 2011, I believe. While they didn't defeat the military, the did end up getting rid of Mubarak and having a large change in the government. A victory no?You mean the political uprising? Rifles didn't do much there, since the ones who made progress were citizens effecting political change. Not to mention that the military was on the revolutionaries side and helped them overthrow the president politically. Your example doesn't adress anything I said.&gt; If you have large numbers of officers and enlisted joining the insurgents, you don't think that will have not only a demoralizing effect on the remaining troops, but a diminished recruitment pool?If you have such a large percentage of the population joining then the insurrection never would have happened, because at that level of support nonviolent political actions would have succeeded already. Just like in Egypt.&gt; One, your statement fails to consider current and past service members. Two, you are looking at this like the military is just going to roll in like back in WW2, and carpet bomb the hell out of the place. You think the people in Little Town are just going to sell out the local "Freedom fighters"?No, not at all. That doesn't address anything I said. And yes, many people will sell them out. If they have so much support that literally 0 people are on the governments side then the insurrection would have never happened because political action would have already worked, and better. The little 22LTs wouldn't make a difference at all.In the end, you are focusing on the wrong thing. You are focusing on how possible a massive insurection might be. I am just saying that some rifles don't make a difference, because if you have enough people for your rifles to matter, than you would long since have enough to change things in a way that does not require a rifle. They are simply not an effective weapon to effect political change, as the government has much more effective weapons, so alternate methods will win long before rifles become viable.&gt; get rid of one of only two things protecting them from said gov'tthe only things protecting you from the government are bump stocks, silencers and armour piercing bullets? My deer rifle shoots armor piercing bullets. Nothing special about the gun or the ammo (WWB). It's just an off-the-shelf .308 WIN.so then banning them isnt a big deal if there's nothign special about them. Unless there's armoured deer i don't know about I guess. Unless you want me to hunt with a smaller round, like .223 REM. Same round used in ARs, so it's ubiquitous, and therefore cheaper than .308. But also much more likely to result in a much slower and more painful death for the deer.Elk might be an issue though with .223. Tough hides.If they're not a big deal how about you quit bitching about it?Pretty sure you guys seem to be the ones bitching. Cant even remotely support any gun law change on this sub without furious down votes lol It's because 'armor piercing' ammo is a bullshit umbrella. Typically people would consider steel core ammo as armor piercing, but most rifles have rounds that will pierce soft armor.[deleted]I actually have no issues with silencers personally, better for ear protection in my mind. There's already bans on various things, and regulations that slippery slope has already happened. Bump stocks seem useless and most people didn't even know they existed, so banning them seems fine and will give people on the left a win so they will probably stop giving a shit for a bit. Regardless nothign will ever change in the US with gun laws, that was made pretty damn clear after Sandy Hook. So i really dont know what everyone's worried about. Really just a waste of money in the end. Maybe it will sway a younger audience into watching their programmingWhatever they can do to deflect the conversation away from their 0-7 record is a good idea."More gun control laws" is a phrase used basically the same way as "protect our children" is used.No one is going to suggest amending the constitution, so any more gun control laws will be illegal in the first place.It's a fucking platitude. You have less of a legal right to prescription pain pills, abortion, a drivers license, voting, etc than you do gun rights.The NFL seems to think they exist for political statements lately ..... prepare to watch their popularity plummetThey seem to know how to alienate their audience, huh?So you'd like to ban private companies from supporting social or political causes?A bit curious so is there any industry or  people outside of politicians that should be able to talk about politics. If the individual players all agreed to the same thing how would that be looked upon versus saying "the 49ers"Politics are alienating, regardless of what the politics are. Telling customers that you don't respect their beliefs is a sure way to ensure they don't come back. If the teams were smart they'd stay out of it - sports has long been an apolitical arena where people of many different political views have been able to come together. When a 49ers shirt is politically equivalent to a "I &lt;3 Dianne Feinstein" shirt, that goes away. The relevance of sports in the lives of Americans drops off and profits go down.It's not that the NFL or the teams or the players aren't "allowed" to talk about politics. It's just bad business.The main point you mentioned in this area is that people will speak with their wallets. The only change I would like is that people don't go to great lengths on both sides to convince people that they should do one thing or the other. If you have an issue with politics in sports speak with your wallet and if you agree with the discourse of the players protesting please do the same. The disagreement I have is the exaggerated conversation each side has on the subject.I would personally rather hear [pre-wealth] cash me outside girl's stance on political issues before any 1%er (NFL players, Hollywood, the media).One because most are completely out of touch with the real world and two because some can singlehandedly solve all the problems they are speaking out on.At least a retard would be grounded and incapable of changing things.entertainment is escapist. It's meant to take your mind off your worries for a while then you go back to it. When entertainment tries to adhere to few people's worries instead of being entertaining, then it fails to be entertaining and becomes propaganda. Entertainment with the purpose of speaking politics.My only argument would be that a collection of people are being excluded from political discourse because of the fact that they're in the entertainment industry. I'll agree having to deal with politics in entertainment is annoying but how far removed do they have to be from that industry for it to be acceptable?they become a figure to distract people. The moment they shed that facade, the moment their career typically falters. It's also the thing people with failing careers bring up for a quick single uptick, then are quick to be forgotten.If they were actually willing to admit to being wrong about their political demands, fine. But we don't live in a society where people do that.That scenario could easily happen on some percntage of people in the spotlight but some people do have some convictions about this subject. My only objection is the blanket opinion based on a generalization. Aside from that I accept your opinion.and I pledge to never support the 49'ers. It's a 2-way street.ehh, think they'll be fine w/o you.Right now they are the second worst if not the absolute worst team in the league. What you should be saying is they'll be shitty w/o you. Its been a hard few years since Harbaugh was let go. wow, just looked up their stats post 2014.  0-7 now, 2-14 in 2016, 5-11 in 2015.  good thing I'm not a 9er's fanAlso in that time frame we had a head coach that looked like a cross between Mario and Ron Jeremy...... it's been rough.It's not just him/her, many people feel that way. Gun control is a pretty polarizing issue. It's pretty stupid of a business to do something to piss off a large group of potential customers. You can just be a adult and realize people have different opinions then you. That way you can enjoy your football teamOrrrrrr businesses could avoid issues like this to avoid alienating fans?sure, they dont have to donate anything, but its San Francisco probably goes along with more fans political beliefs then those who are so sensitive they would stop being a fan. You *do* realiize that most people in Silicon Valley are niner fans and most in Silicon Valley are markedly different than the people in SF. There's guns everywhere in Silicon Valley. I can't believe I have to inform you of this but there's many 49er fans outside of SF. ok and if this tiny donation is going to stop you from being a fan of your favorite football team then go protest or something I wasn't talking about me. I'm only saying that your point about this going along with the political beliefs of the fans is bullshit and betrays the truth that you've never even been to the area. So perhaps you shouldn't speak about things you don't know anything about. and all im saying is if a small donation that wants to ban bump stocks, and armor piercing bullets and improve police and community relations is so upsetting to you that you would abandon your football team then go for it. &gt; go protest or somethingMaybe by like, boycotting them?if armour piercing bullets and bump stocks are that important to you then sure. You do realize there are :1) People outside of San Francisco that are 49ers fans2) People inside San Francisco that are against gun controlThis is just bad business.  If they would have done nothing, then they would have not alienated anyone.  Instead, they went in the opposite direction.So then never support them again I don't care. It's not like any gun laws are going to change especially with Republicans in charge. Americans clearly are OK with high gun crime and mass shootings in exchange for thier hobby. &gt; exchange for thier hobby.You mean our rights. fine you're willing to put up with high gun crime and mass shootings in exchange for your rights. that better? They can't win a game with or without you...I wish they'd pledge to learn how to play a game of fucking football but that's just me.Like I needed another reason to hate the Niners.Yeah, well if you're prone to assaulting women, you'd probably also want to disarm them, so no surprise here.Yay. More Politics in the NFL.  This should strengthen the brand!  /sProbably what's left that they didn't have to pay Aldon Smith.Well, they just lost a life long fan. Fuck the 49ers. Good on them. Not that it'll help. We've had more than enough atrocities to justify real action. If a pile of dead kids didn't sway people, nothing will.Why don't they just make mass murder illegal?Maybe they should make it legal so that it's not cool anymore and no one will want to do it. Ya taking guns from a populace never ended badly for that populace.Tell me what law would have prevented the Las Vegas massacre. They are still too racist to play Kapernick. Yep must be racist, couldn't have anything to do with him being a shitty QB. Aaaaand there’s the race cardWhat's race got to do with it? He is just an idiot who thought he had a right to make a political statement, then found out he didn't have a right to a job.As long as police are a thing and Kapernick isn’t playing NFL QB then we can’t move forward as a country. That is complete and total bullshit. Kapernick was an idiot and will never play again, and we will all be fine.Then we can’t move forward as a country. The baltimore ravens were close to signing kaepernick until his girlfriend tweeted some stupid shit comparing ray lewis to a house [slave].[Source](http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baltimore-sports-blog/bs-sp-ravens-ray-lewis-colin-kaepernick-20170905-story.html)The bottom line is he's a mediocre quarterback that wanted too much money and isn't worth the drama he brings.  If he were an elite quarterback he'd have a job, but he's not.The police are the only thing keeping the people who hate the police safe and alive.Nice memeTIL the police--all of them, across the entire country--make staffing decisions for the San Francisco 49ers.Dissolve all police departments and Kapernicks problems are solvedObvious troll is obvious You were dropped as a child, weren't you? "Kapernick" left the 49ers... not the other way around. Just FYI.Doesn’t make him a good quarterback 
4.4 out of 7.6 billion people are in AsiaCertainly, but it's *still* typically seen as second/third world. This kind of change is a symptom of a slow reversal.Reversal may be a bit conspiratorial.  The rest of the world is, slowly but surely, getting on-board with capitalism; this is the result.  It is a good thing, it'll create competition, and maybe force us all to be better.I don't think it is. China essentially controls rare earth, most manufacturing, is developing new energy sources and investing heavily in wind and solar and the robotics industry is expected to be larger there than in the U.S. in the coming years. Other neighboring countries are taking the example, but developing more slowly because their government just isn't as efficient.To quote Loopers:*"I'm from the future. You should go to China."*The U.S. isn't going to suddenly become a dystopia because its not the richest country on Earth. There are already arguably better places to live. Britain is doing fine besides their European identity crisis. People need to stop being self-conscious about being the best, and start just trying to make the U.S. a better place to live.China is very very dirty,  I made the mistake of traveling there for work in January and the smog was so thick i couldn't see 1 block in front of me.  i was there for 2 weeks and after i got back i couldn't stop coughing for about 3 weeks.  China still has a long way to go as far as living standards go.  Also the internet is not as sophisticated as the US, they have banned google, facebook, youtube, twitter, etc. Basically all the sites that are staples of the internet.&gt; Basically all the sites that are staples of the internet.Is it wrong that they don't want people soaking in the American propaganda? Also, I have been to China too. And yes, the air is dirty. But for the most part, their cities are magnificent and well kept.&gt; Is it wrong that they don't want people soaking in the American propagandaYes. Fucking hell, why is that even a question? Censorship is wrong. The Chinese government isn't doing this to protect the people... It's a method of control. The reddit hivemind really loves China all of a sudden.  I don't get it at all.  China saw how cost effective manipulating idiots on the internet was for Russia. &gt; their cities are magnificent and well kept.I have a friend that lives in Beijing part of the year. He routinely complains about parents allowing their children to squat down and shit in public thoroughfares. I mean every city has problems. To call any of them magnificent and well kept is pushing it for most every city on the planet these days.I don't think it's going to become a dystopia either. When I said "reversal", I simply meant that the center of commerce, wealth, innovation and power will shift from the West to the East.Meh. If China can avoid revolutionary violence for the next 50 years or so, which historically is not a great bet. Given that they are a repressive dictatorship I don't see a stable future there long term... people are gonna want more than that system can provide in terms of freedoms, access to information, etc. The only thing placating their citizenry has been a huge 7%-8% year over year growth of their economy, which is slowing down, big time. Not to mention they are on the cusp of a houses crisis that will make the US housing crisis pale in comparison.For some reason I highly doubht a shft of commerce, wealth and innovation is going to happen without significant upheaval or conflict.And it's not like this shit hasn't happened before. For example the wealth of the Roman Empire eventually shifted to the East in what eventually became the Byzantine Empire. Money and power are constantly shifting and with technology changing as rapidly as it is that's probably only going to accelerate USA number one has a great ring to it.  But i guess we can keep saying it.  Vast areas of the United States already are a dystopia, there have been better places to live for several decades.The United States is absolutely in its first stages of collapse - you are right, it will not turn into Liberia, however to understand your predicament consider the UK pre 1939 and today - that is where you will be within the decade.The Commonwealth ruled most of the planet. You have gone up the stairs and down the elevator - shaft.UK's GDP per capita increased 4.5X since 1939. How does that account for inflation? That's real gdp growth in 2013 pound. British living standards improved considerably since 1939. Doesn't sound like too much of a bad deal to me.Also, keep in mind the British Empire and American Republic are set up quite differently. The USA is almost entirely contiguous, has a homogenous culture (everyone is American, from Alaska to Flordia), and it's natural resources are all located within it's heartland. The British had to maintain control over a quarter of the world's population, ranging from Chinese in Hong Kong to Zulus in Africa, whilst slowly granting more and more independence to its white settler colonies. Britain itself being a tiny island with relatively little natural resources, lost its position as superpower when it lost its colonies abroad. The USA doesn't have this disadvantage, Alaska wont rebel, we don't have to ship raw materials from Africa over to the USA, etc. As much as I agree with this, most Americans will still buy into a narrative where the USA is becoming a dystopia because, as Rick Bobby put it:  "If you ain't first, you're last."America *used* to be #1, so that means that means we need to elect someone like Donald Trump who doesn't give a fuck and will blow up all the other countries that think they can be #1.&gt; America used to be #1, so that means that means we need to elect someone like Donald Trump who doesn't give a fuck and will blow up all the other countries that think they can be #1.America peaked in the 1960's.  It is our grandparents, at this point, that had a different mentality and approach.  One the devolved and led to everyone becoming more comfortable and more lazy.  We've become more focused on bullshit ideas, don't take risks and do not innovate in many areas anymore.  Even our children learn in school to be risk-averse, only have controlled experiments with expected outcomes (for schools that still do anything with science), and have been told that they can ALL be winners without a real clear explanation about the reality.  We're not number one, and we never will be again with the current circus/political arena.  If you think we can just go blow-up other countries, I have a reality check for you - the US cannot take on the world.  Aaaand y'all took my comment seriouslyYou realize that the US became #1 after WWII because Europe was a war torn wasteland and we were able to take over large amounts of manufacturing from them, right?I can only really speak for manufacturing but,  while china makes a lot of things.  Mexico is on the rise due due to growing wages in china and increased shipping cost.  Additionally Apple is actually buying up a lot of the PCB manufacturers in china thus forcing out other potential product.  It is at a point now where it is impossible to get fast turnaround on PCBs.The US still has a massive medical manufacturing industry and  India is still a major player when it comes to manufacturing. In my experience i have heard a lot of talk about moving manufacturing out of china and taking it to mexico.Sure, but China's manufacturing era has already done its job. Investments are flowing. Both fossil fuels and manufacturing jobs should only ever be considered a stepping stone. Counting on cheap human labour for manufacturing is a short-term solution when renewable energy and robots are going to become the norm.Cant argue with that,  robots are definitely the future of manufacturing.  However because of China's large unskilled labor population utilizing robots will mean that unemployment will likely skyrocket.  I will be interested to see how China deals with this issue.  The US will likely see a similar issue in the coming years.No one has mentioned that there is a bit of forced labor and slavery in China, which might explain why there are so many rich. It's part if the system&gt;developing new energy sources and investing heavily in wind and solar and the robotics industry... Maybe we should start doing that then.No coal is tremendous we need more coal.China will suffer a horrific demographic collapse, though. Both the gender imbalance and one child policy will make our Boomer generation look like child's play.also unlike the US, china has vested interest in rare earths, and other natural resources in other countries. they dont have the same stigma associated with western countries trying to extract natural resources, or partner with the host country.Looper was the first thing I though of when  I saw that headline.&gt;  The rest of the world is, slowly but surely, getting on-board with capitalism;No... not at all... not even the US is on board with capitalism... if that were the case, we wouldn't have bailed out the banks or auto-industry.No capitalism is not a good thing imoIt's not worth it for billions more to be fed, be healthy, be educated, and to have real opportunities if the system that enables these development *feels* perverse to your economically illiterate mind, eh?Take into account this guy sits on his capitalist ass all day and posts on Reddit.....300+ posts in last 24hrs alone.Not really That's not capitalism While you are right, they are seen as this not because of economics, but rather their relationship during the cold war. First is affiliated with the US, second is the USSR, and third is unaffiliated (non-European, Switzerland isn't 3rd world for example). What you're looking for is Developed-developing-undeveloped.Because of the consolidation of wealth they only need to have ~1/20th the wealth we do to have an equal amount of billionaires.  Probably even less than that given their willingness to exploit extreme poverty that the US doesn't do.&gt; Probably even less than that given their willingness to exploit extreme poverty that the US doesn't do.Where do most products in America come from and why is this the case?&gt; willingness to exploit extreme poverty that the US doesn't doOh believe me the US billionaires are willing. They're very much willing. Look at the Koch brothers, they just can't have their ways because we have actual laws preventing them from doing so.&gt;Certainly, but it's still typically seen as second/third world.By who? No one with a brain thinks this, literally no one.Isn't the first, second, third world status tied to participation in some treaty of some other non financial concept? Not their GDP or quality of life?This is because up until the last century all the wealth of a gigantic portion of the world was being funneled into Europe.And then immediately after WWII a lot of that wealth was then funneled into the US.Kind of. Asia has a number large cities that are easily considered first world. Yep, but they're methods aren't as good, hence the results.  I bet there's more in the entire eastern hemisphere than in the US as well. Jesus...is this what passes as economic analysis these days?Why are we comparing a continent to a country?Why do we even care? 'Oh no, they have more mega rich individuals than us, better fix that!'I assume it's just to see which way the wind is blowing. Wealth is power, and world power is apparently redistributing. The fact that Russia, China, and India have to pool their billionaires together to beat out the US’s suggests otherwise.Asian countries in general have just been in a perpetual state of “catch-up” to western ones despite having the largest population on the planet.Because until recently, there were more billionaires in the US than in Asia?  “There are as many billionaires in the US, which makes up only 5% of the global population, as there are in all of Asia, which makes up close to 50% of the global population.” -that is an insane stat.“There as many billionaires in all of Asia, which makes up close to 50% of the global population, as there are in the US, which makes up only 5% of the global population.” - not even nearly as impressive.Or to phrase it like this: “There are 10x as many billionaires in the US per capital than there are in all of Asia per capita”Wow a continent with just under over half the total global human population has more rich people than one country with 5% of the worlds population. Good job "Asia". Maybe y'all should work on getting those other billions of people some clean running water.  [South Asia’s Water Crisis: A Problem of Scarcity Amid Abundance](https://asiafoundation.org/2015/03/25/south-asias-water-crisis-a-problem-of-scarcity-amid-abundance/)Did you know that the sun contains more atoms than America’s entire nuclear stockpile?We should nuke the sun Country with the highest GDP in the world - Flint, Michigan.Mmmm, salty![deleted]Just under over half?&gt;Maybe y'all should work on getting those other billions of people some clean running water.as if that's not an issue in america as wellAww you people can't stomach us having more billionaires than you hahaha.Looking at my graph, I think you SHOULD have more...Per capita, we're kicking the shit out of you. How does it compare to the average or median...So what? We still have more bacon, probably.Source: none I'm just assuming we have more bacon because it sounds right Most pork in the U.S. is exported to China.Yeah, but do they make delicious bacon out of it? [Maybe](https://pxhere.com/en/photo/785639)I 2nd this assumption because, bacon. I agree with this 2nd. The USA having the most bacon is probably a true fact that sounds good in my head.As of 2016 China alone has more billionaires than US, though their aggregate wealth is still below the US. But a lot more of them are self-made than US.http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37640156Canada? Mexico? Come on guys. Step up and help us out here. &gt; But don’t shed a tear for the richest folks in the U.S.: American billionaires still control the most wealth at $2.8 trillion.Oh wait never mind. $ quantity beats # quantity. Just give it a few more years.I would hope so since it has 4.1 billion people more. That it, we need more tax breaks for our rich, and we need to cut wages for the middle class. Edit: Do I really need the /s here?  Seriously?Careful, pointing out the many failings of such a system will get you lots of downvotes. Perhaps even an angry comment or twelve. Of course they do, they keep working and studying while the rest of us idiots are protesting offensive nothings in the street. There is a reason why asoans are the best off in America and abroad. Comparing an entire continent to a country... You've got moxy. good. let them have it.  billionaires have been ruining this country since always.  we'll keep the good ones like Gates and they can have all the rest of the evil fucks. 2.4 trillion will be transferred to heirs.  We should eliminate taxes on inheritance.  The kids.......great great great great great great grand kids could never surviveTop comments are all angrily defensive.  It's not like some gloating piece, it's just information.  I hope cause Asia is a continent and the US is a country.And also better test scores...Asia is a continent, not a country. Japan is in Asia and so is North Korea. Income wise, polar opposites. China has over a billion people. The majority are not even remotely wealthy but there are a lot of rich people who gain from others pain. Vietnam and Thailand are both in Asia but the average citizen in either country isn't even remotely rich. Percentage wise, there is no where near as many billionaires in any Asian country nor in Asia in total.&gt; there are a lot of rich people who gain from others painAs is the case in the vast majority of countries.U.S. has more Super Bowl victories than Asia.And it is going to keep growing as long as our government, under the guidance of companies' lobbyists, continues to hinder growth and competition.This isn't a healthy competition.Edit:Downvoted for pointing out having more billionaires means less people can support themselves.Wealth distribution is a real problem ppl. No one needs a billion dollars. No one.That isn't how money works - Newton's first law doesn't apply.The economy isn't a closed system: new wealth is being created all the time.  It isn't true that in order for one person to be rich, others must be poor.You can't endlessly apply a meme like it's a law of physics. lol.New wealth is not created at a rate you can set with a scroll bar. Wealth creation means nothing if it all stays at the top anyways.You think wealth creation stays at the top?  I mean, sure it might in some places, but it doesn't in the US.You think it doesn't?&gt; You can't endlessly apply a meme like it's a law of physics. lol.I'm not: /u/elyn6791 is.  His claim is that wealth isn't created or destroyed, but just moved around.And he's right. It is. You're both ignoring major factors. He really shouldn't have to apologize to billionaires to make his point though.If wealth is not created faster than it is taken, then it doesn't matter that it's created. And it long since hasn't been.Hedge Funds don't create anything. They distort things.Yet another person making an assumption about my understanding of the subject. I didn't realize I couldn't address 1 aspect of it as negative without having a broad conversation about of how the whole of healthy economy works.Carry on with your assumptions. Argue amongst yourselves.&gt;It isn't true that in order for one person to be rich, others must be poor.It also isn't true that we can all be wealthy in a system that defines "success" as having more than you need in excess x 10000000.Are you suggesting we can just destabilize currencies so billionaires can horde more cash and that doesn't cause irreparable harm to others? Explain. In detail.&gt; It also isn't true that we can all be wealthy in a system that defines "success" as having more than you need in excess x 10000000.I agree.  I don't see how it matters, but I agree.  Success is personal, so long as you don't trample on the rights of others, define it however you want.Funny how westerns only get mad about the number of billionaires when it looks like asian countries are outperforming the western ones according to capitalist metrics. I could care less who has more billionaires. That you are accusing me of being "mad" about it just shows your maturity.I've made lots of money. I actually decided to make less because I'm happier and lead a less stressful life as a result. I don't have as much extra cash and I actually have to pay attention to my finances now but those aren't bad things.I'll say it again since you are probably 10 or haven't yet realized it, besides there being a personal cost to wanting more than you need, no one needs 1 billion dollars. For someone to accumulate that amount of money, it comes from depriving it from others too.If your definition of how successful you are depends on the balance of your financial statement, then check your ego.People will run with anything to a stupid extreme. I can't believe people think this is good for us. But Bots are also a thing. Who knows?E: They act like wealth isn't really "created" until the rich and politicians "create" it out of the hands of the poor and middle class. Or they pull it out of thin air through legal loopholes somehow. Sounds like legal counterfeiting basically. I don't see how the effect would be a great deal different.I know that's an oversimplification, but I'm not trying to write an essay here.nobody NEEDS a billion dollars- but I disagree that nobody should be allowed to have a billion dollars.If you can build the product build the company and make the billion- more power to you.That said- policy shouldn't be built around making life EASIER for those with a billion dollars. Way to invent an argument. You can have it with yourself for all I care. Just pretend I'm in complete disagreement like you pretended to know what my position was, then give me another absurd reply.well i mean- if you're gonna go with what people NEED-food, water, shelter. That's it.Nobody NEEDS electricity. Nobody NEEDS the internet.I'm just trying to inject some form of nuance into the conversation but I mean fuck me right.Just pretend I'm still disagreeing with you and you can read my mind. Also that I just said something combative.Continue.petty juvenile response punctuated with overarching arrogance with little thought aside from glorified self righteousness.am I getting close?Lol, I think with you I'm just going to have a pointless argument because you clearly make assumptions without provocation.So I'm simply encouraging you to keep doing it. stop when you get bored.i think we should let you decide how much money is too much- every other opinion be damned.Well I think (whatever amount you think I think) is enough for any individual.What do you think of that?might as well just pick an arbitrary numberMust be cool to be able to tell a billion workers that they all have to be equal and then create a super class of billionaires.Communist China is the most capitalist country in the world.  Billionaires basically getting away with slave labour.That's okay. Asia has more dead girls from selective abortions, more abject poverty, more slave labor, more government corruption, more child labor, more sex crimes, more devastating pollution...You can keep your billionaires. Frankly, I wish most of the US billionaires would move to Asia. The whole continent? Surprised this hasn't happened alreadyI don't think I'm being trickled on hard enough.And they're buying up property too expensive for Americans to afford. If the tax cut goes through and crushes the economy and the small guy, we may as well give the country to China. We'll all be the poor workers making shit for China.
It was a Taiwanese ship that saw them and called the Navy. Sure, sounds like the Navy did a great job. But credit to the sailors on the Taiwanese ship who spotted them first."they had water purifiers and more than a year's worth of food"so in other words, "Navy cuts short the sailboat journey of 2 Americans and their dogs by seven months"Or "Women who were prepared to get lost at sea actually got lost at sea and had to be rescued."I wonder if they knew what they were doing. I would assume if you feel confident enough to take a sailboat in the open ocean you would be capable of using the sails if needed. On one hand they were smart enough to stock up with plenty of supplies, yet on the other hand their navigational abilities were "off". Wonder if their GPS had gone down and they didn't know how to navigate via charts and a sexton. You'd think they'd have at least one if not two cheap backup/handheld GPS devices onboard. Or maybe Zeus (the dog) had tossed those overboard after sabotaging the primary GPS system..... What they needed to learn was star navigation. Don't even need that sextant or astrolabe, a fixed point on the boat's mast while standing at the wheel or even one's hand held up can help get some positional estimates and bearings. That'd be enough to keep them going in one general direction and there's nothing electronic to go wrong at all.Tell that to them. IMO, Anyone attempting a oceanic voyage on a sailboat should at least have basic nautical navigational skills with charts, compass and a sexton.  Those dogos need a walkA happy story is a nice change. So they had a sail? They bring a year supply of food but not a gps or a sAt phone?Hoping they had some breadcrumbs for that 3rd dog...These guys should have had a 406 PLB or something. I mean they’re only like $300....You should also post this to r/upliftingnewsI wouldn't be out there to begin with to be in this situation.. I'm not taking a cruise ship not sailing a ship I'm not going out beyond the beach.
nice of the guy who placed 2nd, to offer the trophy to her and said that she was the real winner No joke, that was classy af.Must be hard to be proud of something you win on a bullshit technicality. This what happens when people ride the fence on social issues on the hope it just "goes away."  Whoever was in charge wanted to please everyone so they just didn't make a decision and they end up looking like an idiot.  Either she shouldn't have been allowed to compete period, given it's a boys competition, or she should be allowed to compete as part of the team and individually and reap the rewards of her superior performance.  But to have her scores count toward the team score but not individually makes zero sense.Then how the hell was she able to compete even?It sounds a person's scores count toward both a team competition and an individual competition at the same time.  __If__ a school doesn't support a girls team, then girls may participate in the boys team so that girls aren't locked out of team play.  However, they do not get enrolled in the individual portion of the event, so her scores don't count toward that.  TLDR:  She did not compete in the individual tournament. stupid rules that her coach knew about but neglected to tell her. her strokes count for the team, but not her personally. because excluding her would be sexistwell that worked out well It sounds like it was for practical purposes and not intended to be a statement. Not enough girls for a separate team, or maybe the boys needed one more. Edit: My bad, that's what I get for not reading the article first.&gt;According to the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, girls can play in the boys' golf tournament as part of a team, but they aren't allowed to be entered as individuals.So, really, it looks like there was no reason to take her off the podium. Even one of the rules officials agreed that she should have been awarded the trophy.It was a boys competition......she was allowed to be on the team but not compete for the individual trophy. And there was no girls competition.  So it should be just competition.  &gt; And there was no girls competition.[There was one earlier and she competed in it.](http://www.telegram.com/news/20171024/lunenburgs-emily-nash-beats-boys-by-4-shots-but-miaa-rule-prohibits-her-from-winning-cmass-d3-title)&gt;According to MIAA rules, “Girls playing on a fall boys’ team cannot be entered in the Boys Fall Individual Tournament. They can only play in the Boys Team Tournament. If qualified, they can play in the spring Girls Sectional and State Championships.”&gt;Last spring, Nash placed third in the state sectional girls’ tournament and fourth in the state girls’ tournament.Well then, I guess the question is, do they allow boys on the girls tournament? &gt;43.2 A girl may play on a boys’ team if that sport is not offered in the school for the girl, and a boy may play on a girls’ team if that sport is not offered in the school for the boy. When a sport is offered in two different seasons, each individual must participate on the team of his/her gender. [Source](http://www.miaa.net/gen/miaa_generated_bin/documents/basic_module/MIAAHandbook1719.pdf#page=42)Of course not.Except they are so...Yes, if the boy claims he is female. And she could claim to be male. She just can't be both at the same time.Well, if it's in the rules it must be ok then. What's your solution? Boys aren't allowed on the girls teams, since they're considered to have an advantage on driving. Are you saying it's OK to just let it go one way but not the other?I mean, in a world based on logic and reason and not sensational/emotional feelings, that makes perfect sense. Female athletes, in general, are not able to compete with male athletes. That’s not an issue of sexism. But in that situation, it makes no sense to bar a woman from playing with men if she CAN compete, while there is obvious reason to keep men from competing in a women’s league. [deleted]No you wouldn’t, because then how do you gauge that? And how often do you test for it?No, it's still unfair to base separate leagues based on different lower limit criteria but allow them to be merged based on upper limits. If girls can compete with boys, they play together. If they can't (or often enough) you have separate leagues, it's a very simple concept. Either you admit the skill levels between genders aren't significantly different, and they play together or they are different and they don't. Either way the best will win, as competition is meant to be. How is that unfair? Who gets shorted except people who are not actually good at their sport and want an easy mode?Edit: there are obviously going to be rare women who CAN compete due to genetic lottery. That isn’t a ruling on the average female capacity. And those women who win the genetic lottery can dominate their respective leagues. OR! We don't have separate leagues and what happens then?Feelings get hurt because women will often lose to men (aside from the genetic lottery winners) because we then acknowledge that men on average are better in that sport. This unfairness and double standard is brought on BECAUSE people are too sensitive and want to avoid those hurt feelings. So there you go, logic and reason means screw hurt feelings. You still haven’t said why it’s unfair to allow a merge of leagues based on higher level. A woman who won the genetic lottery might not be content to crush her league. Why should she be limited to playing against people who can’t compete with her?No one denies male athletes top out higher than women, do they? I’ve never encountered it. So who are you suggesting is protected by the absolute binary system?&gt; It was a boys competitionAnd she kicked their asses. 4 strokes under the best playing boy, from the same tee. If any sport shouldn't be gender split, it's fucking Golf. Driving distance could always be a factor, but even then it's more about control than acting like Happy Gilmore. Any woman in the LPGA would crush a good amateur, but there's a reason why the LPGA exists and women hit from the women's tees.At the scholastic levels, though? It shouldn't be separated at all.Or, if the schools are going to segregate the teams according to sex, then they should provide equal funding, facilities and coaching for each team. False. There's a reason women have never done well on the PGA tour.That said, it's not like football where it's a safety issue, so her money is good money. That would only make sense if girls had an unfair advantage over boys in golf, which they don't.The long drive record for a woman is 406 yards, for a man it is 516. I think its safe to say men still have an advantage in some regard. I think this competition should probably have been an open event without gender restriction, but it wasn't. Start a girls tournament, start a gender neutral tournament. Yes, start a gender neutral tournament, and in the meantime acknowledging her win and give her the trophy.  At least the boy who officially won was a good sport and demonstrated more maturity and grace than some of the adults involved.This is why in the ultimate world, and many sports, we have open and womens divisions. Open is effectively men, but if your a really good lady, you can play and beat some men. Same thing for disc golf.True in the bowling world too. Their money is green, or blue or fuschia too. They did specifically say "girls" and "boys", which I took to mean children. Power is not really the point of games for children, it's hand eye coordination and skill/control. At least, that's what Andy Murray recently said in an interview. They're not prepubescent children, it's high school.They do in younger levels but by high school boys are bigger.&gt; According to the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, girls can play in the boys' golf tournament as part of a team, but they aren't allowed to be entered as individuals.Sometimes I wonder how these rules make it through without anyone raising their hand saying "that's stupid".Then I remember that I lost my first job for raising my hand and saying "that's stupid".You are fired from Reddit. Somebody from T_D will escort you out of the building. She should begin loudly stating that the league is admitting that girls are better at golf than boys, so the boys need to be protected from her superior skills.That's a tough argument to make considering all the other sports that are split up and that she played in a tournament that others were excluded from. I assume she went from the same tees as the others, but I didn't see a confirmation during a quick read.The rules of the tournament said girls could compete on a team, just not individually. Apparently, even one of the tournament's rules officials said it was a dick move to not name her as the winner.&gt; That's a tough argument to make considering all the other sports that are split up and that she played in a tournament that others were excluded from.It's a tough argument to segregate the sexes, but they are doing it. Make the claim, let them defend against it. It'll be fun.&gt; I assume she went from the same tees as the others, but I didn't see a confirmation during a quick read.I did. They said it. Same exact game. She won.I missed that confirmation in the quote block.  That'll teach me to skim and assume correctly. I had assumed it, but seen it in passing (slightly better skim). I couldn't imagine making the "I won" claim if she'd been playing by *any* different rules.I rarely play golf. Did (very little) when I was a teen, and then never as an adult. Had a girlfriend after my divorce who liked to play, and when I told her how long it had been since I played, she insisted I use the "girl's tee off point" to help me out. After the first hole, she insisted I switch back to the guy's tee off. Then after I won she didn't want to golf any more. lol. I guess it came back pretty quick. Or she's a horrible player. Not sure which.If she was hitting from the same tees, that's a bunch of bullshit.Time for the state to deny funding for this tournament until these rules are changed. Edit:To those who are down-voting me:Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 is a federal law that states: "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."There's a girls tournament and she earlier competed in it.Suffer the children for the actions of the adults, right?Or... Force the responsible adults to correct this case of illegal discrimination as quickly as they can.So keep hosting the tournaments and lawyer up. Have them change the rule while letting the kids play the game they want. Cutting off funding means cutting off golf for those kids in those tournaments.If they just THREATEN to stop the funding, these rules will change in a matter of weeks. The courts have repeatedly upheld these Title IX requirements and any decent lawyer would advise the tournament organizers that they will inevitably lose in a court of law and that they would probably face the imposition of penalties for legal fees. What do you think is more likely?1.) They will change the rules to make sure girls are treated equally in the boys tournament?2.) They will remove the rule that allowed girls to compete in boys tournaments if the school had no girls team?I'd assume they will do 2.) because it's far easier and otherwise they'd be in trouble for having girls only tournaments and mixed tournaments. Also mixing both completely has quite a couple of opponents I'd assume, so yea, just removing 2 would be the quickest and easiest change.According to Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972: "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."The school district cannot fund a school team for the boys while not providing an equivalent team based opportunity for the girls. Under Title IX, the school district would have to either create a girl's golf team (With a comparable budget for a tournament) or they would have to allow girls to compete equally on the boy's team with equal status (Including the ability to win)&gt;The school district cannot fund a school team for the boys while not providing an equivalent team based opportunity for the girls.Yes, they can. They don't have to offer the same sports for boys and girls, they only have to offer equal opportunities for sports for both. Which is the exact reason why this tournament allowed girls to participate in the first place, due to the lack of female teams.The article also states that the spring tournament is for girls, while the fall tournament is for boys (and girls, but with the rule that they can't win). &gt;, they only have to offer equal opportunities for sports for bothThe school does not have a girls golf team. How can Emily Nash play in the spring team tournament if there is no team for her to compete with?Let the lawsuits commence!Time for a co-ed team to come in and kick both other teams butts!I'd laugh if they decided to give it to the runner up and the runner up was a girl too.
Well fucking good. Goddamn. Really, what's the lowest denominator that we have to explain civil fucking rights to. I used to think these people are malicious. I wasn't prepared for the truth that they're soooooo fucking *stupid*Somebody needs to be sued to hell and back just for that absurdity being included in the first place. How the hell would you boycott Israel in the first place?why was that even in there.Why? Because of Right Wing Christian Fundamentalist politicians who require and enforce government support for Israel due to the prevalent belief (In the Bible Belt) in dispensationalist eschatological "End Times" prophesies by themselves and their political supporters. That was one messed up city, not all over the stateFrom the article:  Gov. Gregg Abbott signed statewide anti-boycott legislation in May, declaring that "anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies." The so-called Anti-BDS (Boycott, Divestments, and Sanctions) law took effect on Sept. 1.How is that ban not unconstitutional?Talk to the rule makers aka legislators.
Yes... Ontario, almost twice as big as Texas. There's a massive lake by the same name right beside it.Do we really need "Canada" in brackets&gt; Do we really need "Canada" in bracketsYes, there are cities in the USA called "Ontario", in Ohia and California. Maybe more? Saying "Ontario, Canada" does avoid some confusion. Yep, there's one in Oregon too. And I live near it so the first thing I think of when I hear "Ontario" is the small city in Oregon, not the large, internationally significant province. Just helps keep things un-ambiguous. Like, to most of the world, "Vancouver" means the one in British Columbia, but for me growing up in the Portland area, it means the one in Washington State. And yeah, Washington State vs. Washington DC is another example. If the title just said "New York", would it be a state law or a law in New York, New York?I really like how you captured the OH accent perfectly.In what part of Ohio do they say Ohia?Anywhere where there are less than 500 people living per square mile.I've lived in one of these areas for the most of my life and I've never heard that pronunciation from a local. It's the kind of thing you hear from someone with a twang that we just don't have. Maybe more toward the southeast or something?I do live more in the south east so It might be a local thing lolThat's just some Kentucky inbreeding with yall. Username checks out Thank you brother-cousin. Nerk, Ahia was a popular T-shirt slogan in Newark, OH circa 1975.There is an Ontario, NY, which is located in Western NY on the shore of Lake Ontario as well.there's more than one lake connected to ontario though.the only one that doesn't is lake michigan.but the other 4 have shores in Ontario.If they apologize they'll be appropriating our culture. In This Thread: People who don't understand the difference between "protest" and "Harass and intimidate".Believe it or not, harassment is illegal already. And unfortunately that wasn't enough to stop it from happening. This solution will still allow protests while reducing the chance of someone being harassed.Before it was a matter of having to prove harassment. It's much easier to prove some jackass with a sign was within  harassing distance of an abortion clinic. Just takes a photograph.Having a sign is harassment? Have you seen /r/pics before?It can be, yes.This isn't just about protecting people who seek abortions.  These protestors harass everyone who enters the building.  Sometimes they follow people inside or even all the way to their homes.  This might come as a shock, but the vast majority of people who enter these buildings are not seeking or performing abortions or have anything to do with them.  These are health clinics under siege by idiots.  Good. No woman should be harassed, judged, or insulted for making a choice about what happens to her own body. And no woman should be forced to be a baby factory for an unwanted child based on the decisions of someone else. And to anyone who thinks it's okay to harass a woman for getting an abortion, please read "[The Only Moral Abortion Is My Abortion](http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/anti-tales.shtml)".We are people, not incubators. only because canada is more clear about separation of church and state.and we have nationwide laws supporting abortion (at any stage of pregnancy). in fact, canada is one of the most liberal countries in the world in regards to abortion laws.contrast this to the States where abortion laws differ from state to state and states have more power in this area than the federal government. and the entire US government was created with church and state being very closely aligned.as former Prime Minister Trudeau said, ["There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation."](http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/omnibus-bill-theres-no-place-for-the-state-in-the-bedrooms-of-the-nation)Harassed and insulted, I agree. But judged? Judging happens in your own head privately and I will judge whoever I see fit because what's going on in my head is my business.Judging a person in your head is a small bit different than screaming your opinions at them in front of a doctor's office, don't you think?That falls under harassment.You are free to judge a person in your own head. I am not disputing that. What I am not okay with is people openly judging women for getting abortions, calling them murderers and baby killers to their faces, acting self-righteous while never thinking for one moment that they or someone they love might one day be in the same situation, needing an abortion themselves. I personally want there to be more baby killers, maybe we'll get this overpopulation under controlWell it would have to be all African, Asian, and Indian baby killers. We already have that, it's called Climate Change.Could argue infectious diseases as well unfortunately. every square inch o the planet could have people in it ans we would still be fucking.I know it's politically untenable, but having some sort of incentive to be sterilized. They can be different from region to region. Ob. a 1000 tax rebate for life in the US wouldn't work in India.Thinking about history, I would apply it only to men.I say something both more and less radical than sterilization. Licensing. Unlicensed pregnancies would be criminalized and terminated. We'd have to make damn sure the licensing system is as fair and equal as humanly possible but there would be a minimum standard and a maximum number that everyone would be subject too. Already have three kids? No, you don't get to have any more. It doesn't matter how well off you are cause nobody is allowed more than three. On the flip side, you are unemployed and living off social assistance due to your drug addiction? No, you don't get to have a kid right now. Nobodies saying never, just not until you get back on your feet.What if a woman has three kids, gets pregnant, and hides it long enough to give birth again? What should be done with the illegal fourth child? [oh, I don't know...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6PkDHuaXi8)^^I ^^couldnt ^^resist ^^:PHow is that less radical than easier sterilization and incentives for a reduction in kids? "Allowing people to never have kids easier is too radical... FORCED ABORTIONS AND PRISON SENTENCES IS GOOD THO"[deleted]1 in 3 American women will have abortions in their lifetimes. Chances are that one of these women is someone you know. Your mother, sister, aunt, coworker, friend, or neighbor. If it was you in that situation, with an accidental pregnancy you couldn't afford to have, would you be so quick to judge? In your response you didn't refute the fact that they are indeed baby killers. You are just trying to use that user's family, because you know he wouldn't like his sister/mother/etc. to be called a baby killer. They aren't baby killers. In Canada, the law states that life begins at birth, not at conception. Laws used to say that Black slaves were not human beings. Were they right? Using the law isn't a good argument. I'm pretty sure that every scientists agree that life begins at conception. The only difference between you and an unborn baby is that you're more advanced in your development. But I can rephrase your statement as: "In Canada, the law states that a VALUABLE life begins at birth, not at conception".For the first part, you do have to take the law into account. It is what we have currently decided to be the best option. Doctors are not required to do abortions if they do not want to, but people do have the right to ask one, and safely receive this medical treatment. Laws are is NOT set in stone, and when we realize that there are problems, we can (and do) change those laws. Secondly, as a scientist, I would disagree that life begins at conception. I believe that things that were never conceived (such as bacteria) are alive.  I'm not a botanist, but I don't think the plant or fungus fertilization is ever referred to as conception either. As for the definition of life, I guess that I am considering the requirement that life be self sustaining.  An embryo at 3 days, even a fetus at 19 weeks, cannot do that. It relies on a woman to pump the nutrients in, and the waste out. Human viability is currently considered to be at 24-26 weeks of pregancy, when a fetus can be delivered, and there is a 50% chance of the baby surviving (chance of developmental delays are generally quite high at that time). I fully support you in your fight to prove that human life is viable earlier, or that my frozen 5 day embryos can live and grow into babies without any human intervention. But at this point in time I, and Canadian law, do not agree with you. Just wanting to point out that by your simplistic definition of life, every invalid and old person isn’t “alive” because they need medical assistance or they’ll die.  Everyone with a pacemaker is pushing it. That doesn’t even consider every parasite in existence, literally evolved to survive but not be alive by your definition. Life is life.  At conception what you have is alive. Society just doesn’t value it like it values a child, adult, dog.  It’s a small and insignificant thing that you can swat away for your convenience like an insect.  Abortion is too common. It’s not the act that disgusts me, I’m still pro abortion, though not as generous with the window as Canada’s laws are, it’s how casually some of us try to rationalize away the reality that you’re killing something for your own benefit that disgusts me.  As I said, using the law as a counter argument isn't right. Again there was some stuff in the past that were legal, and that we today find horrible. I just find it hypocritical when people say life begins at birth. You can say there is a big difference between an embryo and a newborn, but what is the difference between a baby one day before birth and one day after birth? Is it still a "bunch of cell" like I usually hear? If someone was to shoot a 9 months pregnant woman in the belly, killing the baby, but the mother survives, would the killer be sentenced over the dead baby or just for shooting the woman?&gt;I believe that things that were never conceived (such as bacteria) are alive. I'm not a botanist, but I don't think the plant or fungus fertilization is ever referred to as conception either.Conception is just the fusion of gametes that create a new organism. It's a synonym to fertilization.&gt;As for the definition of life, I guess that I am considering the requirement that life be self sustaining. An embryo at 3 days, even a fetus at 19 weeks, cannot do that. It relies on a woman to pump the nutrients in, and the waste out.Human viability is currently considered to be at 24-26 weeks of pregancy, when a fetus can be delivered, and there is a 50% chance of the baby surviving (chance of developmental delays are generally quite high at that time).The baby relies on his mother to pump the nutrients while he's in the womb, but he doesn't stop relying on an outside help to feed himself after birth. He doesn't become self-sustaining right after birth. So according to your definition of life, a newborn isn't alive.Accidental pregnancy. What? Do you not understand how babies are made?Failed birth control. Or a freak occurrence where one or both members is supposed to be infertile. I have personally witnessed the second twice, though both couples did in fact want kids in those casesFair enoughOr cases of rape and incest, which while not discussed often, do occur with frightening regularity. And how often do rape and incest abortions happen?This is like 1% of abortions...[deleted]The image of a woman “putting” a dick in her pussyLordAnd if you're raped? Objectively wrong[deleted]Objectively you are wrong. You do not have a difference of opinion, you have a misunderstanding of facts. &lt;silently judges YayCookiesForever&gt;I agree with this. Because I’m not an asshole. You agree with it only when it's applied to something you agree with. which he agrees with because he's not an asshole.Which part of his sentence was difficult for you to understand?Yep, you gonna cry about it next? Well depending what you mean by next you may cry about it.. is next they ban protesting capitalism within 100 metres of any place of commerce?--maybe that's fine.. what if you can't protest police actions within 100 metres of any police jurisdiction? ...how about not being able to protest a public figure within 100 m of their district? ...thesee seem a bit over the top huh?--how about not being allowed to protest a movie within 100 of theatres showing the movie..?Once you move the protest 100 from the thing you are protesting you may as well be signing a change dot org petition from home ~~&amp; calling it a day~~ *posting it on your social media so you can get your public virtue sigal on*, &amp; calling it a day--because that's all that it accomplishesThey already regularly do this in the US.  It happens everywhere in the Capitol, happens around police stations, happens around political speeches.  Basically anywhere where the powerful don't want to see protesters.  How come it's okay in those cases, but not for a woman that just doesn't want people to mess with her when she's getting an abortion?It's not ok in those cases.Protesting anything is virtue signalling. These crazy religious nut cases were not protesting, they were harassing women on account of their crazy religious nut case beliefs. &gt; Protesting anything is virtue signallingThere's countless examples of protesting affecting real change and to reduce it to "virtue signalling" is insulting.For starters a protest shows the government there are people that support/disapprove an issue to the point they're willing to significant time on it. It bring awareness to other citizens. etc.So basically, you dont like it because if completely different laws were passed they could be bad. Thats retarded. Thats like saying that mirder shouldnt be a crime because next they could ban self defense.Hint, if your only arguement against something relies on a slippery slope arguement, then you are probably wrong and should rethink your arguement.That's okay timekilleraccount we have crossed paths before &amp; I've seen what you imagine passes for logic enough to know not to bother considering your input or judgement. Have a nice day.I dont remember you at all. Probably because you run away and use personal attacks when confronted with logic and sourced facts.If that all it can accomplish, the it didn't really have much support to begin with.Wow, what a revelation.Banning free speech? You kind of are a dick tho It's not banning free speech. You move about 50 feet away, so you can't spit in their face or stalk them outside their homes (the reason for this new law). The horror.Also free speech ends when you're harassing others. They made the law like this so that those being harassed (the doctors and nurses were being harassed too) don't have to keep records and then try to prove that the protesters did it.It's meters not feet FYI I meant more steps away (general estimation) rather than the distance in length.According to the SCOTUS, it really is infringement on free speech to push protesters that far back. The court was particularly concerned that people w/ faint voices might not be heard at that distance.SCOTUS has zero authority over the Canadian province of Ontario.Except the moral authority of defending speech rights with reason and evidence.Their job is to interpret the US constitution. Nothing more, nothing less.There is no moral authority in regards to SCOTUS and Canada. Strange that moving people away is infringement, but requiring permits and "free speech zones" isn't. Logic doesn't quite work out there.This instance is in Canada, and I'm unfamiliar with laws there, but in the US, "free speech zones" have routinely been found unconstitutional. Permits are acceptable because they aren't permits for speech itself, they are permits for large gatherings/assemblies. So long as the permits are issued uniformly, without bias toward or against certain speech content, they are constitutional. When you start legislating people's right to speech based upon the *content* of their speech, you get into free speech concerns. In The US, a speech-proof buffer zone like this wouldn't be allowed at all as it clearly targets protestors based upon the content of their speech. &gt;they aren't permits for speech itself, they are permits for large gatherings/assembliesThat's really no different from what's going on here. You accept permits for protestors because you understand that there are safety concerns inherent in a large number of people assembling in one place.Well, there are safety concerns in this situation as well. People are being harassed and there is a long history of violence targeting abortion clinics, doctors, and patients. How is a 50m buffer area any different than a permit for a specified protest area? It's not about the speech, it's not about their opinions being unpopular or not PC enough, it's about the very real potential for harassment and violence.Why would American judicial decisions matter at all in another country.Because they are based on reason and evidence that ought to be plain to all. There's nothing special about Canadians that would obviate concern for the fundamental human right to protest in public. When you push protesters far away from those they wish to speak to, you silence them.There's nothing extraordinary about American judicial decisions that would have any bearing in another sovereign nation. Your SCOTUS is not our Supreme Court. What your courts say *don't matter here*.All this does is create a buffer zone so women aren't harassed on their way into a clinic to get a legitimate medical procedure done. Their right to protest isn't being taken away, they just can't form a gauntlet to be run.It's a perfectly acceptable compromise.It’s really something that you end arguing with an American about his/her insistence that their courts and laws should somehow be applicable and supersede Canadian courts and laws. The fact that this thread exists is telling.It's like when they show up at our border with a handgun and a conceal/carry permit for their state, like they think it somehow applies when they leave their country.  It never dawns on them that hey, other countries have different laws and *aren't* America.It's an incredibly childish and naïve argument on their part in my opinion American laws mean nothing to another country.How jingoistic. Sorry dude, but your first amendment is overreaching and ridiculous, and I am very glad Canada didn't adopt it.This is in Canada. Canadian laws apply. Just pointing out what principle Canadians have missed in their zeal for muffling free speech.We’ve missed nothing. Now go make a diaper out of your flag you obnoxious twat. Would you protect a group of Atheists standing outside a Church's entrance every Sunday and scream to families about how they are indoctrinating their children and their whole life is based on a lie?Sure, as long as they stayed on public grounds to do it.That said, this is Canada, not the US. Canada does not have the same free speech laws the US does.I guess this just comes down to the subjective opinion of when protest becomes harassment. I'm agnostic but even I respect theist's right to practice their faith in peace without being subjected to a disturbance not made in good faith.You’re entitled to your shitty opinion.Glad I’m an AmericanAgain, you're entitled to your shitty opinion. Golf clap.I prefer freedom to live a life unharassed and partake in society without fear of verbal abuse. If you think your free speech trumps other people's safety and security then you have no ground to be calling other people dicks. No ones safety and security is at risk though. These are words...You understand that people are being stalked and followed and harassed and intimidated, right? Oh, but no one's been killed so it's okay. More important to protect freezepeach morons from getting their feelings hurt while they wave their gore fetish around and scream and berate people trying to get healthcare.Harassment is not free speech, people have a right to walk into a healthcare clinic without being screamed at by nutjobs who think that a zygote has more rights than a person. Harassment is subjective in this instance. We can't start legislating against subjective harassment. As long as no ones rights are being infringed on, I don't see the problem. These are words...Protestors get to invade the space of people wishing to go to the abortion clinic, that's ok?Making these protestors who violate personal space move away so the people wanting to go to the clinic, that's not ok?What the fuck is wrong with people?edit: made it a bit more clearWhat are you saying?  Protesters should be able to invade people's spaces at abortion clinics?No I am saying the opposite.Reading the comments in here people are ok with violating personal space to push their agenda, but when a law is enacted to protect the personal space and people who want to visit these clinics is, these people cry out about how free speech is being banned.Ah, I gotcha.  I honestly think you should just be able to slap people when they get invade your physical space.Isn’t half the point of protesting to be a burden on others in order yo draw additional attention to what you have to say.  For large political matters, sure. You want politicians to notice. All these losers are doing is impeding the access of individual patients to legal healthcare. They're pointing out how people seem to be fine with anti-abortion activists harassing patients/workers going into clinics, but limiting their ability to do so by legislating a minimum distance seems to be getting some people worked up.For my part, I think this should have happened earlier.I think we should have these procedures preformed at hospitals / normal surgery centers. At the end of the day, they are medical procedures and should be treated as such, and the patients should have the same expectation of privacy. It's no one else's business why you went to the hospital, and i assume in Canada your medical history is private and privileged information. Many of these places are within larger hospital complexes, or sometimes standalone, and yeah, healthcare information is considered privileged. Ah i see, in the US they are generally performed at standalone locations, so i figured that the patients would be able to hide in the normal traffic of the hospital but perhaps that isn't possible. I'm the US too many hospitals are part of a religious organization and they won't perform certain procedures because their religious nonsense is more important than the medical autonomy of their patients. I wonder what the people would think if a bunch of people scream, yelled and tried to prevent them from getting into their church wold say?Is that happening with the same regularity as these protests? Posing a "what-if" doesn't exactly make much of a case.Maybe it shouldWhat if it was a union picketing a buisness for higher wages?Would you support a law for this?That depends on whether the protesters are following the workers home, or harassing customers.Or murdering them..You can plenty harass customers for doing something morally depraved (supporting a bad decision)Remember https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez#Workers.27_rightsIt can go the other way very EASILY. Arizona did it.Then you arrest and remove if necessary the rights of the people going too far, there is no need to hinder the rights of everyone protesting because some assholes went too far. It depends on the conduct of the picketers.Also there's a substantive difference between a woman's right to an abortion and an employer's right to underpay their employees.the er are laws like that. IN the last 50 years, union protest have been far more civil then people protesting clinics.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez#Workers.27_rightsChavez protested illegal immigrants by reporting them if they did not unionize. I wouldn't call that civil. You may claim I am defending slippery slope bs. but the slippery slope is some ways. Establishing precedents like this can also work against you in the opposite way.Do those unions protesters have a history of becoming violent and harassing people? Not all situations are the same.the UFW both reported illegal immigrants for not unionizing and also one time attacked strikebreakers. Unions can be violent too.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez#Immigration&gt; Unions can be violent too.That's not "having a history". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_violence_in_the_United_States#Laborers_Local_91.2C_Niagara.2C_New_York.2C_1995-2001?Yea, a long time ago. Are the current union demographics violent? I haven't heard or read anything recently. While pro-life protesters have been known to be prone to violence for a good while now. That's a good point, in that light this law seems poorly thought out.No, he missed the point of the law entirely lol.Not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, I don't think harassment should be protected as free speech. On the other hand, it's entirely possible to protest outside an abortion clinic without harassing the women walking in, and I do think that right should be protected.I also don't like the sort of precedent this sets. "We can ban protest in certain areas, when they are for a cause we disagree with". Can a conservative legislature vote to ban protests near right-wing speakers on a college campus? If not, how is that different than this?Unlike the USA, Canada does not have the utmost right to free speech. *Limits on speech were incorporated in the criminal code in relation to treason, sedition, blasphemous and defamatory libel, disruption of religious worship, hate propaganda, spreading false news, public mischief, obscenity, indecency and other forms.*Also, unlike the US, Canada does not have any legally defined limits on abortion. Although medically inadvisable, third trimester abortions are completely legal in Canada, which even many pro ~~lifers~~ choicers consider to be too far. That might have something to do with people's opposition to the clinics in Canada. EDIT: I'm an idiot. The ones that late are done in a hospital and are generally vetted by the hospital’s ethics committee first. Source: my Reproductive Bioethics professor in university who was on one those committees. Of course. That said, the problem isn't a legal one when it comes to third trimester abortions, but rather an ethical one. Medical boards operate on a strong ethical platform, giving them a degree of self-regulation beyond what the law requires, but that is the limit on late-term abortions. The law is perfectly fine with aborting a 9 month pregnancy with no complications.I think you mean pro choicers.Well, this is a decision between an individual and their doctor. That's the way it should be.There's a point where it's an ethical concern. It's legal to abort a pregnancy at 9 months, when the baby is pretty much fully formed and viable. The "fetus" is even conscious and responsive at that point. Sure, it might be legal, but is it ethically acceptable to kill the fetus at that level of development? There's a reason that, outside extreme circumstances, abortions are only legal in the first trimester.Can you give me examples of this happening?I don't this is actually an issue. If we want to start forcing restrictions on abortion, there should be evidence of a problemDoesn't really happen. Not that it matters.&gt; It's legal to abort a pregnancy at 9 monthsNo one is getting an abortion at 9 months. They have a cesarean section.&gt; There's a point where it's an ethical concern.There is no such point. A woman either has a right to her own body, which **nobody** can tell her what to do, or she does not. A woman's right to choose is absolute. Who gets to draw a line in the sand and say that a woman stop having the right to her body pass x number of days of the pregnancy?   A woman's right to choose is not absolute. When two people's rights conflict, the law has to decide which right supersedes the other, and the law has decided that a woman's right to bodily autonomy does not exceed the right of a person to live, namely that of the developing baby. The problem lies in when the law confers personhood.In the US, it is around 12 or 14 weeks, so prior to that point abortions are legal, and after they are not, barring extenuating medical circumstances. In Canada, personhood is conferred at the time of birth, so there is no legal restrictions prior. That's also the reason you can't be charged with double homicide for killing a pregnant woman in Canada.So to directly answer your question, the law decides. If the developing fetus is legally considered a person, the woman's right to bodily autonomy does not exceed the fetus's right to live; if the fetus is not a person, then she can do whatever she wants. No one's rights are absolute, and there will always be times when two rights conflict. The legal system has tools in place to determine priority, and this is how things are chosen in the case of abortion.So after 14 weeks, a woman is has no more rights to her body? Bet the pro-choice folks are thrilled with that reasoning.  Great faulty logic. The whole point behind the pro lifers is that the fetus IS NOT “her own body”. If you truly believe that there is nothing special about a 9 month old fetus that would turn in to an adult human once taken out of the womb then you need help. I love in threads like this when people are talking about which principles they ascribe value to and someone comes out with "the country being discussed doesn't have the rule your desired principle would need upon which to piggyback in order to be considered a valid legal question for the country being discussed".. as if the value of the principle is somehow lessened because law...but never minding that--you don't think those limits have pretty much identical counterparts stateside?There's at least one relevant point in talking about the law. Canada doesn't have the same protection, but we haven't slipped into some dystopian nightmare like the slippery slope crowd might have you believe. So I think the argument when people bring up the law is that it is possible to balance protecting people from harassment with the principle of free speech.Well.. Canada already had harassment laws... so the harassing kept happening because existing laws weren't enforced with respect to those crossing the line from protest to harassment..the response to that of making protesting a thing where it is relevant to do so against the law is clearly a step too far if applied to people protesting things we largely agree should be protested.. it is just like the pit bull ban: if the laws on the books were respected /enforced there would be no need to go banning a whole species--it's like going title IX kangaroo courts because not enough is being done to prevent rape on college campuses..except .. no one is being mauled or raped in thsee protests. People are being name called and yelled at. Harassed too. But if they were being assaulted the assults would mean assault charges, not 200m of space...And I know at least once I was in Canada and saw signs warning there would be fines for smoking within 9m of the doors those signs were on.. yet surrounding the doors were people smoking...is the solution to make it illegal to sell cigarettes within 100m of buildings where it is illegal to smoke by the door? Ban lighters with 50 m?  Orrrrrrr maybe just enforce the exiting laws so people don't just stand around breaking them without a care..?.. maybe..?...Except history has shown: clinic protesters get dangerous.They just have to move over a bit. It means they can still protest in the area, but not right outside. They were also having problems with the protesters doing it outside the doctors and nurses homes.It's just a way to protect them. You move about 50 feet over instead of being in their face. It also makes it so the people don't have to try to get evidence of being harassed  (Which is really hard to get). I'm fine with this law. I've seen what some protesters were doing to women who walk into those clinics. Some of them weren't even there for abortions! The same thing also applies to rightwing speeches on college campuses though. People who go to listen to these speeches are regularly harassed, abused, and threatened. Yet we're told on reddit regularly how that's just "free speech".Canada isn't the US.I get what you're saying, but it's just what it is.Actually it is very common to seperate protestors by 50 feet or so at protests. This is no different. It is a safety issue.Safety issue in some places. I do agree that speeches themselves shouldn't be censored. But colleges have their own approach and can do what they want.As far as I'm concerned, this is a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on a protest, which has always been permissible.I understand where people are coming from when they have concerns about this not being content neutral. But, the way I see it, the restrictions aren't based on the content, they're based on the conduct that seems peculiar to this content.In other words, it's not that the protesters are pro-life, it's that pro-life protesters tend to misbehave in these situations.It's not the content of their views, it's the behavior they have a history of exhibiting.This came down to the behavior of these protesters. The people who protest abortions are more likely to be violent which has been seen over the years and has become a problem. This only sets a precedent for certain demographics of protesters who are more likely to be violent imo. Moving these kinds of protesters is just reduce their ability to harass and become violent.Sure, they could protest without harassing people, but they usually don't. Instead they impede patients from accessing medical procedures that they have every right to receive. The rights of the protestors end as soon as they start hampering the rights of others. Did they actually impose a section 33 exemption?  Otherwise there's no way that this qualifies under a section 1 exemption.  The protestors can't abrogate section 7 rights, but neither can the government abrogate section 2 rights, and there's an automatic inherent bias against government stepping on people's rights rather than people stepping on each other's rights (since the point of the Charter is to promote democracy and limit the government's otherwise absolute supremacy).I'm with the abortion clinics, just to establish which side I'd prefer to side with, but I'm almost positive that this legislation is a massive Charter violation that'll get overturned rapidly on appeal, and I'm surprised the provincial legislature went for it.  Might just be a political statement to try to scare some of the chodes off.Out of interest, is Abortion completely legalised in the US and Canada? or is it one of those things that people just look down upon?Completely legalized.  The law restricting abortion in Canada was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1988 ([R v Morgentaler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Morgentaler)).Parliament was unable to pass a replacement law (2 failed attempts by the Tories) and the matter basically became a third rail, so the matter remains entirely in the hands of doctors, which is where it belongs.I can't speak to Canada, but it's a constitutionally protected right in the US.It's based on principles of bodily autonomy (you have the right to decide what happens with your body, which is why you have to opt in to being an organ donor, for example) and privacy.States can put restrictions on access to abortion, as long as they aren't "unduly burdensome." That standard is subject to interpretation, so the issue is constantly being litigated as states hostile to abortion push the boundaries on limitations.The two most relevant SCOTUS cases are *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey v. Planned Parenthood*, if you want to know more.Although someone needs to remind the red states because they still think that a zygote has more rights than a human being. Interestingly, we (Canada) do have a relevant Criminal Code prohibition that theoretically bans abortion, but it's of no force or effect due to the Morgentaler case that Masark mentioned.I'm fairly sure it's one of the things getting culled from the Code on the upcoming cleanup.Free speech zones move north.It's just them allowing people who use these clinics to go there and to have some space between them and t he people harassing them.&gt; speech You misspelled "harassment". maybe they shouldn't have made shaming and harassing the people walking into the abortion clinics such an integral part of their protests.I think there were  probably some better and easier ways to accomplish this same result.[deleted]Who's taking away your freedom to protest? You're allowed to do it, you just have to be a certain distance away. You're either purposely sensationalizing this or you didn't even bother to read the article you're commenting on and I'm not sure which is worse. Good. More of this please. 
Lisa Bloom is the perfect example why people don't like lawyers. What a piece of shit that woman is. She should be disbarred. Weinstein was also apparently producing a mini series based on a book she wrote so it's pretty obvious she would want to defend him [Weinstein and Jay-Z](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-lisa-bloom_us_59d68d12e4b0f6eed34f18ae)&gt; But Weinstein and Bloom have an earlier business connection. Weinstein, along with Jay Z, is producing the TV adaptation of her 2014 book, Suspicion Nation, which examines the trial of Trayvon Martin’s killer.Lisa Bloom is excrement in human form.  Yeah, an utter and absolute piece of shit in my book too.  Ugh.Disbarred for what?There is something very wrong with our legal system where rich people can keep those without the same means from talking due to fear of lawsuit.I dont know the answer, I can't think of a better system, but itnis disturbing how that many people can be shut up.&gt; brhunkmofIs that German for something?That's German for "a brother who's a hot motherfucker."Just shit phone typing...Where was that originally&gt; itnis disturbing how that many people can be shut up.There will never be a day in human history when money doesn't outweigh justice.Everyone has a price, these people are just capable of meeting that price where most aren't.People like Affleck have PR teams in place to basically neuter any complaints against them right when they start, and since the media was complicit in hiding the Weinstein details for over a DECADE where can the victims go?The media won't report it and the bribes keep getting higher until eventually you cave.  You can choose to blame the legal system if you like, but the truth is the media hiding this kept it going for as long as it did.After the incident on United with the passenger who was knocked out, the local media quickly published embarrassing stories from his past. You can also sense quiet pressure in how Casey Affleck keeps slipping under the radar despite two harassment settlements. It's not that no one mentions his record; but those references get isolated, and don't build momentum.Your upset he isn't being found guilty in the court of public opinion like everyone else is right now. Much higher standard to actually prosecute people in court.You can say shit on the side and make references all day long, due process isn't supposed to work like that.You talk about the media like it's one big entity, but it's not. If the media was so intent on hiding Weinstein, then why does literally everything I know about the case come from the media? I've read it all on one news website or another. The only answer is that if some individuals in the media wanted to hide it, then others wanted to expose it, and the latter group won. But I get that that doesn't make for a simple narrative, and it's hard to understand for some people.It's more that experienced industry people understand the incentives of the media. Without a critical mass of accusers, each individual outlet faces the consequences of reporting without seeing the social, financial, or reputational benefits. Yup, up until now this shit would of been considered slander and libel. We found the one type of case now where that won't apply...until someone is successfully sued for it.One of these hundreds of stories is bound to be false, then the backlash will begin. We should all keep this in mind before we make definitive statements regarding this issue - could bite us all in the butt.&gt;There will never be a day in human history when money doesn't outweigh justice.It is so depressing to me to know that so many people can't imagine a future free from injustice fueled by the rich and powerful.A better world is possible but that world doesn't involve the rich or a system that legitimizes their wealth with power.or conversely a system of people willing to do bad things for money. The rich and the powerful would not be able to pay off people if they refused. Just like Harvey Weinstein wouldnt have done whatever he did if actresses weren't willing to fuck for a role.As long as people are human and free, they will pursue self-interest, regardless of wealth. "Poor" aren't any more virtuous, and "the rich" aren't any more evil, they just have the means to act out their plans better than others.You're right.  Throwing enough money at a problem usually makes it go away, even in too many criminal cases.  It's sad that we have an entire class of people that suffer from affluenza.  When we move past money. We don't really need money in a post scarcity world. We'r not there yet. I feel as though the only people who will benefit from a post scarcity world are the ones who are currently stupidly wealthy. The rest of us will just be left to die of famine. If people are dying of famine, it isn’t post-scarcity.He means everyone will die during a transition period I think. Seems likelyI don't understand why a young, rich, famous, good looking  star like Affleck needs to grope anybody. Women would be throwing themselves at him continously.That's part of the problem. Some women do throw themselves at him, which can lead to the false idea that the abhorrent actions are acceptable. I am not blaming the victims but rather those who accept the wretched behaviour. Why would women throwing themselves at you make you think abhorrent actions are acceptable.Because if it works even just once, the mindset is that it will work again. If we get good enough AI we could replace not just diagnostic doctors and lawyers but judges as well. Paired with robotic technologies we could replace police. I for one welcome our stern, stern but fair robot overlords. I don't know why you had downvotes; I literally and earnestly agree with you. Can wait until humans are no longer trusted with this type of thing; we have just the shittiest possible track record.Eh, fair is going too far. There have already been reports showing biases in decision making by AI for sentencing and bail/bond offerings. A system is only as good as the person building it and the data it's fed.Yeah, I did say..."If we get good enough AI". And where have they been using AI for sentencing and bail? I looked it up and all I can find are risk assessment algorithms. I don't consider that AI. Really? I would - it's making decisions based on algorithms. To me that is using artificial intelligence to perform an action.Kicking out a programmed score based on answers to multiple choice questions isn't intelligence. My calculator isn't intelligent.    Yes, but your calculator isn't making a decision. If you're making a decision based on values, I'd consider that to be using intelligence.It's kicking out a score based on a program. Programs like COMPAS aren't making a decision either, they're kicking out a score based on entered data. Same as a calculator. For example, you enter the person's age and [COMPAS](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) uses it's preprogrammed ranges for each age group to kick out a score for "risk of violent recidivism". It was programmed to give higher scores for young people than older people based on nothing other than "old = 2, young = 6". That's not intelligence. That's just assigning values that are already programmed in by someone and adding them up and kicking out a score, exactly like a calculator. It's 2+2=4, or young+black=10 risk. It's a calculator. Someday we will dismantle capitalism and celebrate it's demise yeah and abuse of power only happens in capitalism amiriteAbolish the hierarchy that wealth and power enjoy under capitalism.No gods. No masters.Hierarchies of power only exist under capitalism amirite? Just look at how open the USSR was and Cuba and China are. Pretty much I'm just going to leave this History of The USSR &amp; Communist China here Or perhaps you would like Modern VenezuelaPlease don't be a dense reality-denier. Abuse of power happens wherever there are insufficient checks on that power. Capitalism isn't unique in promoting a lack of meaningful regulation of power.Those are state capitalist governments The USSR was not. China has only gradually become so — they were extraordinarily abusive of power in Mao's time, and the Cultural Revolution occurred in response to non-capitalist collectivist local governments' abuses of power.The ussr was always state capitalist. You can't be a state and be communist. Then communism will never exist. Anarchy is inherently unsustainable; as nature abhors a vacuum, human nature abhors a power vacuum. Abolish the state and in short order you will either see a charismatic leader emerge, convince enough strong/armed men he should be in charge, and establish a new state likely much more oppressive than the one you ended, or else be conquered by an external state.We need Tort reform. We need to make it easier for the rich to buy lawsuits from the poor for a bulk sum of cash.Then it becomes the rich fighting the rich, and the poor get cash.These women also had too much money in a way. If they were empty bags like 50% of the population, the threat of a lawsuit wouldn't mean shit. They had too much to lose.Fuck you money is a parabola.Yeah, if only they were poorer they wouldn't be as worried about Weinstein lawyers/sThere is a saying that the king and pauper are the only two people in a kingdom that can ignore the laws. &gt;Fuck you money is a parabola.Are you sure it's not an ellipse?No, having the money probably helps the critical mass to accelerate once accusers start to be aware of each other. If you look at stories from truly vulnerable populations, like female janitors, the critical mass never develops unless the government takes the reins.That first part is why I've always had issues with people who claim free markets will allow for protection of the public through the use of lawsuits for damages.  The rich will just throw more money at the suit.Yep.The deck is even more stacked when it come to liability, pollution, etcRose took the $100k and decided to stay in the industry. What does it have to do with the justice system?She could of left the industry to pursue this and didn't. I feel worse for the ones that were either forced out or so disillusioned with everything that they gave up on their dreams.This shit has impacts on others as well. I had to keep quit about sexual harassment I viewed at work. The person slandered my name for a year within the company and industry, then set-up situations with my managers to help me fail, all the while buzzing about how terrible I am. I gave up my dreams after this, person that was harassed gave up her dreams, he got promoted.After all was said and done, the lesson learned was to not keep quit. Had we fought back and made a stink right after it happened, we had a chance to get justice. You don't think she kept quiet because the justice system is stacked? Not necessarily in her case. She chose this over seeking justice. Whose to say what would have happened? If she’d gotten a rape kit done the day of, provided testimony, or even just made the allegation public, so it wouldn’t of been an open secret anymore. If he’s been charged and she lost, that stink would of stuck to him. It’s like when Michael Jackson was doing shit with kids and didn’t get in trouble. It sure as shit stuck with him and made a lot more people aware that he wasn’t trustworthy. Not perfect but it really just left him with the scam artist looking for payouts to abuse.She chose her career. Her choice, but she has to live with it. Not my place to judge but she doesn’t get an end run around this to be a hero now on top of getting a solid career.I think you’re forgetting how reporting rape is extremely re-traumatizing.  Rape kits are hard to do when the first thing you do after getting raped is take an hour long scorching shower. “Not your place to judge is right”.  Maybe you should have done that and not spent all that time writing a judgey bs post.Reality is what it is. We used to believe that 100 guilty people should go free if it means we don’t lock up a innocent person. We have due process for a reason. It’s not always pretty, but that’s why courts operate on LOGIC and not emotion. Lots of aspects of the court system are retraumatizing. Logically, we can’t seriously compare them and start ranking them and then making excuses for why. Ask a lawyer, you work the case you are given, not the ideal.I don’t like how these cases are being tried in public opinion. A lot of them aren’t rising to the level of crimes either. We’re one libel case from this ending.&gt;Not necessarily in her caseWe dint know what drive it 100% but it must have played a role.&gt;Not my place to judge but she doesn’t get an end run around this to be a hero now on top of getting a solid career.You dint think that hurt her career?Seems to have been doing just fine career wise. Look at the poor woman that weren’t famous and truly forced out of the industry, many of them because they gave up on the dream after there encounter. They didn’t get to feel whole in any way. No one helped them get a settlement.She chose how to close this case. Those poor woman didn’t! They had to just live with it. The answer is an executive order granting amnesty for anyone breeching an NDA for the purpose of exposing sex crimes. Whistleblower protection. We could even extend that to *any* crime past a misdemeanor.Oh yeah, that’s really gonna happen under the current administration. It’s a good thing this is all happening under a President who wouldn’t have any vested interest in keeping sex crime victims quiet.Someone's sexual history is NOT RELEVANT in regard to rape or harassment.  FFS, this woman (Bloom) is trash.It can be relevant in some cases. The woman who accused Mike Tyson had already falsely accused a boyfriend of rape because she didn't want her strict father to find out she was a slut but the jury wasn't allowed to hear it because of Indiana's rape shield laws. I know Tyson sure wasn't a saint but many believe he was framed and the jury should have been allowed to know about the previous accusation.that's false accusation history. Not sexual hsotory.But Tyson is the best kind of target. Tons of money, naive (at the time), anger issues, bad reputation (at the time), and relatively easy to manipulate. Also didn't help that his lawyer didn't have experience in rape cases and he took the stand and lost his temper. A woman should be able to falsely accuse as many people as she wants without it coming up in court. You don't want to discourage victims from coming forward do you?Too bad there's not a basic test to give juries.Until jurors don't believe, *on average*, that a woman who likes to have sex might not have been "asking for it" this will keep keep coming up.This isn't really an issue in the US. Most if not all states have "rape shield" laws that keep out evidence about the alleged victim's prior sexual conduct (or sexual reputation or anything along those lines), with only a few narrow exceptions. The "she was a slut" defense doesn't work because juries aren't even allowed to hear it. Why are you being downvoted for literally stating the fucking law in a discussion about trials?Reddit is a fucking dumpsterfire. Being relevant isn't the issue. Rape shield laws prevent the defendant from using alot of information including sexual history. So it isn't legally admissible in the US.Which is why the act of telling someone you have information on the sexual history of someone is so much more slimy. You know she expected it to turn the story into a story about Rose McGowan's sex life to take the heat off Weinstein.Rose could willingly fuck all of Hollywood and that is her choice. It doesn't mean she can't be raped.Indeed, but there are situations in which her sexual history could be relevant to the perception of the validity of her claim. No, I don't think so. If she had made false claims of rape before, maybe. But, false claims would be the only thing that would be relevant.Look at my bruises, he raped me!She told me to rough her up, she said she liked it rough.I've never had rough sex in my life! I don't like thatHere are 10 ex boyfriends who can all testify that you.. Rape shield law!!!!!!Yeah, never relevant. edit: Aww.. downvotes won't make it any less true.The answer is not settling and ensuring these assholes are criminally prosecuted.At least one lady did just that. She even agreed to wear a wire for the police, and that's how we got the recording of Weinstein admitting to it. That *still* wasn't enough to get him prosecuted, because he made a donation to the DA.The same DA that refused to go after Don Jr and Ivanka Trump as well. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/cyrus-vance-donations-donald-ivanka-trump-harvey-weinsteinYeah, above and beyond what I just mentioned, America needs a massive cultural shift on how we treat and regard women in our society.Everyone has a mother.  It baffles me that people would treat a woman like a sex object, but then again, there’s a lot of “benefits” for women to play that role.&gt;Everyone has a motherJust FYI, this attitude contributes to the problem, not away from it.Women are people, persons, with human dignity and full rights, in and of our own selves.We shouldn't *need* to be defined as "someone's Mother", "someone's Sister", "someone's Daughter" — as if our existence, dignity, and rights are justified only by our relationship to someone else.Treat us as people."People" is a vague, impersonal concept. "your mother/sister/daughter" personalizes it, putting a face and a connection to the abstract concept. Part of me suspects you understand but are trolling. Jesus Christ, split hairs much?Some random dude: "We need a massive cultural shift on how we treat women, because they are related to men"Woman: "Respectfully: You could treat us better *just because we are human*, and not because we are extensions of men"Some random dude: "JESUS CHRIST LADY YOU ASK TOO MUCH"*downvote shower*----------— yes, we do need a massive cultural shift.No, it isn't going to happen from people Just Saying Magic Words To Get Karma.You demolished the very principle you espoused.As long as people operate as you have, women will never be respected.Ehh, I get what you're saying, but you pretty much completely missed the point. When he pointed out everyone has a mother, he means most people have at least one woman in their lives who helped nurture, shape, grow, and educate them. He suggests that this, in and of itself, is a powerful argument for holding women in the highest regard -- women bring us into this world, they give us life. My mother is the reason I'm here and the reason I'm not a piece of shit. How could anyone with good parents, especially good mothers, just turn around and treat women like objects? You wouldn't treat your own mother that way (hopefully), so why do strangers who've done nothing wrong get the short end of the stick?You could have just asked for clarification on what he meant instead of immediately going on the attack.This one's on you, IMO.I'd just like to point out, that men who have respect for their mothers and were raised properly *are capable* of treating women outside of their family like garbage, and men who don't respect their mothers and were not raised well are probably not going to relate to the original statement to begin with.Would it maybe make some men think twice? Great. Realistically, I don't think it's going to do much. It also seems rather obvious. I don't believe the average man is that stupid/ignorant. *Oh, gee, I never realized my mother was a woman too.* Really?I don't believe OP was being malicious (in his original post at least), but it does seem shortsighted.Please show me [where in my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/78w0ok/lisa_bloom_has_files_on_rose_mcgowans_sexual/dox5y04/) I "immediately went on the attack".I pointed out a problem, politely. I was met with hostility and a devolvement into personal abuse.This entire thread, and TubbsMcHuggs' behaviour in it, disproves your assertion.It doesn’t have to be hostile in tone to be an attack. You attacked/chastised him for saying something he didn’t, and he (understandably) was upset by the implications you made about his character based on your own misinterpretation of his words.And I reiterate — you should have asked him what he meant first. That’s called communication and *that* is how progress is made.His behavior doesn’t prove my assertion, it proves that people get really annoyed when someone manufactures a problem where there isn’t one.&gt;You attacked/chastised him for saying something he didn't--------------&gt; Everyone has a mother[I quoted exactly what he said]  Just FYI, this attitude contributes to the problem, not away from it.[This is a criticism of an idea, of an attitude — not of a person]Women are people, persons, with human dignity and full rights, in and of our own selves.[This is a statement asserting basic human dignity and self-agency]We shouldn't need to be defined as "someone's Mother", "someone's Sister", "someone's Daughter" — as if our existence, dignity, and rights are justified only by our relationship to someone else.[This is a criticism of the idea, of the attitude — not of the person]Treat us as people.[This is a reasonable request]--------------The only way that my comment could be construed as an attack or chastisement on **_him as a person_** is by a narcissist, experiencing an ego wound to his fragile, enormous ego, and reacting to that imagined slight by lashing out.Which is what he did.&gt;you should haveI have a Master's in English. — I *could* have asked him "what he meant" — except that **_he wasn't unclear in any way_** in what he meant. There was nothing for me to ask clarification upon. It would have been a waste of my time, and pointlessly servile besides.&gt;you should haveNo. **_You_** should have treated me as a human being instead of condescending to me, to defend his inexcusable abuse of me — which behaviour continues **with your comment to me**, rather than any sort of observing, on your part, the fact of his **abuse of me**.Progress is made by people taking responsibility for their own failings rather than projecting them on others.And as for "manufacturing a problem where there isn't one" — you are *literally* commenting on a story about a corrupt attorney trying to blackmail someone who was victimised and blackballed by a culture of denying that there is any problem.We women aren't stupid. We see what you devote your energy to — criticising us (**baselessly**) for speaking up against abuse and speaking up for dignity and rights, and ignoring the abuse that happens right in front of your noses that seeks to humiliate, silence, and belittle us.**That** is a chastisement.Thanks for saying it better than I ever could.  You’re spot on.That is not what the poster said, at all.That is a very ungenerous interpretation. It makes sense to reference mothers because everyone was born from one, and it's a powerful catalyst for empathy. Nothing about the quote suggested Mike Pence reasoning.Ungenerous? TubbsMcHuggs is proving my point right now, by verbally and emotionally abusing me for criticising this as merely allowing predators to hide — and not serving the stated ends.He has a comment below where he is trying to claim me as his victim.The point is this: it's happening, *right now in front of your face*. Disrespect and abuse of a woman by someone who Mouthed Magic Words and a woman stood up and said "These are just the Emperor's New Clothes, they only allow for collective denial of reality".But somehow reality is an "ungenerous interpretation". You can't even empathise with me on the basis that I'm an actual person experiencing abuse right in front of your face. Why am I supposed to feel respected?While you are correct I believe that the goal of the saying is to force people to say to themselves "Hey would i behave this way towards my own mother? No of course not! So why am i doing it to this woman?" The concept of equal treatment regardless of sex is a difficult concept for some men to grasp (I don't know why) so you have to figure out a way to bridge that gap. There are a lot of stupid people in this world, i had a serious conversation with one of my tenants last week about their concerns that their apartment was haunted. At the time I didn't know how to react because the whole scenario is ridiculous to me but they are deadly serious about it, there are a lot of stupid people on this planet.&gt; "Hey would i behave this way towards my own mother? No of course not! So why am i doing it to this woman?"Search term MILFs.Check out who serial killers tend to go after first (or who their victims resemble). *Or just look at MatricideGo read all the hate single mothers get.I get what OP was saying but just because they are a Mother doesn't mean people treat them well nor that they are divine entities incapable of flaws, and that's where responder comes in- women, and mothers, are imperfect humans just like everyone else on this planet. &gt;Treat us as people.People using that aren't trying to say you aren't people, or are only defined by those roles, they are trying to get somebody who doesn't think of you as a person to empathize by pointing to women in their life they dint want treated differently for being a woman.I would prefer that men who hate and disrespect their mothers / family have *some* motive to respect me,Or that men who cannot, simply concede that they're incapable of respecting me as a person because of my gender, and accept responsibility for the fault being their own.It's not a LifeHack. It's not a band-aid. It's not a convenient mask for sociopathy to hide in plain sight.If I look nothing like their mothers / sisters / wives / daughters — and they have predicated respect for women based on respecting others through their familiarity?It's just another hole they'll fail through, and which I get to bear the pain of.That is great, most people with a shred of empathy would prefer that. But the 'attitude' of using a phrase to think about how wrong it is to mistreat women for being women isn't "part of the problem".It — it really is.TubbsMcHuggs up there devolved into calling me a "shithead" in a now-removed comment. It was removed by the moderators, but it is still in my notifications.ThreeTimesUp, below, smarmed me with an accusation that I stare at his f'n crotch, so his disrespect is therefore somehow justified. Some hypothetical woman somewhere stared at his crotch so he can't treat me with respect? These aren't isolated incidents.It. Really. Is. A. Bandaid. That. Allows. Bad. Actors. To. Give. Lip. Service. But. Fail. At. Doing. The. Right. Thing.Somebody calling you names proves a tool to try and get people to empathize with woman is part of the problem?!?!It proves that it contributes to the problem.He started out paying lip service to get personal acclaim — and then demonstrated his willingness to attempt to victimise someone as soon as they stepped forward in support of the goal he paid lip service to.This happens over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and eventually it's perverse to claim it's not a syndrome.He *just* commented again to call me a victim — to claim me as *his* victim.You’ll always be a victim, no matter what.  That’s your choice.The point is that you, in specific, are incapable of not being a predator, and that the methodology you proposed doesn't respect women, and only allows you and predators like you to hide your predatory natures.You made my point for me.I refuse to be your victim. &gt; *Treat us as people.*Loathe that I am to play the chauvinist, we'll be glad to as soon as you quit staring at our crotches.Victorian sensibilities have come and gone because they were not evolutionarily-successful.I can't see your crotch through text, now, can I? But you still can't muster the humanity to treat me as an equal?And no, this is not a request for a dick pic.&gt;not evolutionarily-successfulEw you clearly don't loathe being a RedPill MRA If I treated women the way I treat men then I’d never have had sexProsecutor misconduct is striking here.&gt; *Everyone has a mother. It baffles me that people would treat a woman like a sex object...*Because 'mother' is a completely different gender than those whom you are biolgically-programmed to want to fuck.Or were you rehearsing your speech for your followers on Tumblr?Just remember, Mother Nature doesn't give a rats-ass about any of that shit - she just wants to see babies falling out of vaginas and cares nothing for the circumstances that got them there.It’s a different gender?  My mom is a girl, just like these actresses.And I dint know what the rest of your post has anything to do with what I said.This lady has lost all credibility.  Yeah, Lisa has.she’s tearing me apartSo..how's your sex life?that was what I meant. When did Lisa Bloom ever have credibility?  Her mother ruined any credibility of their entire family.Am a lawyer. If the allegations in this article are true, Bloom should be disbarred. I’m confused. What did she do that is wrong? Huh.  I thought Lisa Bloom was a feminist.It's camouflage.She dated Marilyn Manson. There's nothing that could be in that dossier that I would find shocking, or more importantly, relevant to the case. I'm no lawyer, but I kinda get where you have to take slimy clients. Everyone has the right to the best defense to protect their rights, even Harvey Weinstein. What kills me, though, is that this guy obviously did at least some, if not all, of what he's being accused. Yes, he gets a trial, lawyer, jury, the whole nine yards, but you know his money will likely keep him out of jail. That being said, how will this guy get a fair trial? How will you find a jury that hasn't heard of this case and has an opinion about it?My sweet summer child, he already bribed the DA to not get a trial.Upvote for "sweet summer child." Never heard that expression, but I'm stealing it.Game of thrones reference.  Sorry but if you use it you will be forced to discuss R+L=J, the meaning behind the long winter and the Others intentions, and be forced to Hodor when you enter places in front of people.That is terrible of me, I'm a huge fan and it slipped right by me.This article mentions Bloom's involvement in the Ronin Farrow/Dylan Farrow smear campaign on Woody Allen... No matter what you think about Woody Allen, I encourage everyone to read [The Woody Allen Allegations: Not So Fast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-woody-allen-allegations-not-so-fast) with an open mind.Yeah his is one of the few cases that have come up or come back up in the last few weeks where I'm pretty certain nothing at all untoward happened. And I don't think the 'victim' is lying, either. I think she was a little kid who spent her whole life hearing that this happened from people who she loves, who are also convinced it happened, and so she still believes in good faith that it did. Hell, I think Mia Farrow probably believes it did too. And I think the messed up atmosphere in their home- the fighting, the indifference due to wealth, etc.- at the time surely contributed to everything. But the whole thing has a bunch of suspicious points to it. The police cleared him. The doctors involved cleared him. He had/has no record before or since of the sexual abuse of little kids. I'm pretty sure Woody is innocent. The stuff with his stepdaughter/current wife was a bit creepy given that she was only 17-18 when they got together, but I don't think he's a pedo. Lisa Bloom lacks credibility and integrity. Lisa's mad that Harvey didn't have a go at her?History shouldn't be at issue. Either she said or signaled stop or no or she didn't. That's the only thing that needs to be established. At the point the defense should be apologetic unless there is contradictory proof.I am sure Cosby's lawyers tried to smear one or two too. Harvey has too many allegations to consider something as obvious as this defense strategy. This is creepy as fuck.I’m hating this link. All it does it throw pop ups at me Yeah but she’s liberal and hates Trump so it’s all gI read that as ‘flies’.Let's not forget that these accusers also used to brag about promiscuous activity in multiple interviews and that they could've easily stopped Harvey Weinstein by reporting what he had done but instead they decided to focus on their career while he had many more victims. Harvey paid her off to stay quiet yet McGowan is accusing him of rape on twitter. I bet he hasn't sued yet because it's a bad look right now but will eventually.“I’m a famous movie producer, everyone wants an Academy Award, I can really help their careers.” H.W.Somebody took the deal. Who?Had no idea who this slag was, wiki'd her, daughter of Gloria Allred, now it makes sense.I hope she's ridiculed from now until she's dead and bloated in the ground...partisan feminism is as bad as the rapist they defend.
I wonder if he smokes with cigarettes It's fun to do bad things"I wanna do hoodrat stuff with my friends.""Wanna go fast wanna go fast!"Holy shit you're not even kidding.&gt;  and authorities say it's not the first time he's taken the family car. ....&gt; Tow truck driver who responded to 10-year old high speed chase says it's a miracle he or someone else wasn't killed. "He's a good driver."...&gt; As the boy was taken into custody, he attempted to spit in several troopers' faces, kicking one in the chin, according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol....&gt; The boy said he was bored and decided to take the car for a ride, according to the police report.Literally lmao right now. This article is fucking gold.Who wants to start a betting pool on the age this kid goes to prison? Spitting and kicking cops in the face @ 10 years old. He drove through a ditch to avoid spike sticks. WTF 'Murica?&gt; He drove through a ditch to avoid spike sticks.I mean we've all played GTA.This kid is the american dream. Boy ain't takin shit from no pigs! Wow, just wow.  No, this is a future inmate.Or the next NASCAR driver? Shit someone get this kid into a junior dragster.He just wanted to do hood rat things. Thank you for reminding me of this.That boy needs a good old whoopin'.How did this kid become such a dick?The kid is a psychopath most likely.A 10 year old can't be a psychopath I disagree. I don't feel like going through scholarly articles but a child certainly can show psychopathic tendencies at a young age, here's an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/78j45v/ny_how_to_give_an_older_child_not_baby_up_for/ Edit Here you go: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/can-you-call-a-9-year-old-a-psychopath.htmlThat first story about the pin in the eyeball.  Holy fuck.  I hope she heeds the advice about the cameras.  I blame the parentsMe too. I know a couple who allowed their son to self identify as a velociraptor and eat nothing but French fries and ice cream.  Some of these parents should be thrown in jail. What the fuck, seriously?Serious as a heart attack. Holy shit was that kid a punk. This is a meme. If he identifies as a velociraptor, then he must be one.They should have made him eat like one. How many live animals would he have killed before he identified as human again?Some kids are really into killing animals, this kid might have been pumped.They either did too much, or too little parenting.Hey, give a little credit to our public schools. I was thinking the same thing!  He spit in the cop’s face!Children like this are why I am pro abortion until the 57th trimester.Video games have made children excellent drivers.Yeah. It’s crazy to read that and think that he did a better job evading the cops than most adults would have. I learned to drive with a ps2 steering wheel and San Andreas. I'd drive all over the map obeying the signals and rules. Id even take an 18 wheeler across the map and pretend I was a truckerNever had the wheel.  :(  ....but Grand Turismo taught me a lot about acceleration and breaking.Twisted Metal me taught me clowns are dangerous drivers.lol, but I bet you haven't been hit by a rocket launcher while driving eitherI learned on grand turismo 2 while getting licenses for better racesShort story: Growing up, as teens, a friend of mine had a lot of guns. He encouraged his friends to learn how to use them. So we did. Another friend, a gamer type, came along with us to "the range" (literally a mountain side we shot at). He'd never fired a gun in his life. But he'd played a thousand arcade games with a gun. He took a few shots and could never hit the target. That first friend said "You're overthinking this. You know how to hit your target. Just pretend this is an arcade game. Look at your target, point your gun and shoot. Don't think so much about proper aim, you know how to do all that". And he did. And it worked. And he ended up being one of the better shots between all of us. Muscle memory is powerful.I was with you up until you mentioned muscle memory - which i font think is applicable in this situation unless his video games required him to actuslly hold a realistic gun (not just a controller)Arcade games. Many of them in our arcade were weighted and some even had an electric "blowback". By 'muscle memory' I'm referring more to the practice of the aim, not maintaining control in through-fire. "Sight-Picture" is the word you were looking for, not "muscle-memory".This boy thinks he's James T Kirk ?Oh, he probably never saw the Star Trek reboot. /sPerhaps he's very forward thinking and knows this is the only time in his life he can get away with this.This has to be a white kid from some creepy hillbilly holler in rural Ohio.[Westlake Ohio Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlake,_Ohio) 
&gt;August 1975, when her husband dropped her off for a doctor's appointment at a hospital in Monticello&gt; Stevens' husband died in 1985This poor man, spent 10 years of his life, wondering where his wife was. That would fucking kill me every day.  She was 36 when she vanished. My bet is she had something or someone she wanted to get away from. It's not like 36 year olds just get picked up and dumped into nursing homes.I mean they found her by looking for hits on her social security number. Whenever it was she walked off she had enough wherewithal to remember it for when she would need it later in life. Makes me think she was being hard to find in a nearby state in the pre-internet era on purpose and that she did that until she was too old to give a fuck.You feel bad for the guy but if he was any kind of decent then why would a woman with few living relatives walk off and go start a new life somewhere else? That's not the kind of thing someone does because their neighbor's dog barks and wakes them up every morning. They do stuff like that for real reasons. She has no living relatives now so it's likely she had very few if any when she went missing. I can't imagine what it's like to be that alone in life. I can't imagine being that alone, having a decent spouse, and severing the few remaining links one has to humanity and going to live among absolute strangers.Imagine being married, few if any living blood relations, and your life is for some reason so bad that you'll walk away from the few people you do know and roll the dice on a new life somewhere else. Makes me wonder what she was seeing a doctor for in August, 1975. I doubt it was because of a barking dog."Has no living relatives". I would say she wasn't really missing anymore.[deleted]Pretty sure Medicare will pay for it. She was using her social security number, so she probably took early retirement and Medicare pays for the home. Granted it will be a no-frills state home, but they should pick up the bulk of the costs. &gt;Pretty sure Medicare will pay for it.Medicare will only pay for 100 days of long term care and requires circumstances like three nights in a hospital. Medicaid pays for long term care if it can be shown there are no assets to be liquidated and there is no money available to pay for the required care.&gt;Granted it will be a no-frills state homeNot necessarily. I've only known a couple nursing homes who are private pay only. Most take Medicaid patients. 
How could you do that to a kitten. It’s an innocent ball of fur, what is wrong with this guy?He is a sick fuck and deserves a bullet cause it's quick. Personally, what he deserves is to be set on fire and thrown off a building and see how he likes it. Or just put him away for life. He is too dangerous to let out. If he kills animals for fun, he is a suck fuck and needs to be put down. Is this sarcasm? Going off your rocker at some violent dude and talking about the gross violent things you would do to him? better to yet, have big kitties, aka tigers, lions jaguars to tear him to shreds.You can only pick one.Its always pleasureable and seeing someone being overtaken by emotions.&gt;Police said Medina admitted to burning one kitten and "killing a couple a week for fun when he was bored."Because he was bored.Not "I like killing things." or "I wanted to see what it was like." Because he. Was. Bored.Throw the fucking book at him.He'll have plenty of time to be "bored" in jail.Not only is this cruel as can be, but I don't really see how throwing anything against a wall is all that "fun."Maybe I'm showing my age a little bit...Wall ball? Did you not have a childhood? Or did it just take place somewhere bereft of brick walls?Wall ball is great! A tennis ball is the only fuzzy thing you should throw at a wall.A tennis ball or Miguel Medina after you light him on fire.You're clearly not up with the trends. edit: /s just incase someone thinks im seriousBe glad you added that, the internet can NOT discern or take a joke. You don't think throwing things against the wall is fun? What's next, you're gonna tell me you don't like eating wall candy?Edit: ^(Wall candy is a joke referring to eating paint peelings.)Nah, he is a fucking disgusting personHe has the makings of a serial killer. Better he was caught now instead of after his first murder.He's already murdered.You cant murder an animal. Durp!You are getting downvoted because you said it in a dumb way, but you're right. Murder is, specifically, illegal homicide. IDK... I've read several biographies, and there was one or two who grew up with a pet as their only friend, and hate people who abuse animals. &gt; Better he was caught now instead of after his first murder.I'm with you on that one. Anybody who shows cruelty to animals needs to be watched carefully. Empathy and compassion span species. If you have no feelings for animals, you probably come up short on your feelings toward humans. Fun fact: Donald Trump is one of only two presidents who have no known pets. Rent-free.Hello fellow caterpillars!Shh, you'll let people know about the secret club!I dont know why President Trump even needs to be referenced. But ill play along, not having or liking animals doesnt mean he lacks empathy or would do the same things as this person. These things usually manifest themselves early on in life, giving credence to people being born evil.So if you are trying to suggest his lack of a dog or cat at the white house is an indication of a psychosis go fuck yourself. I dont like him either but you have to be pretty wacked to make something like this about him. I was wrong. There's Melania... I can tell your parents raised a classy person. NOT!  You people are so pathetic that you need to interject your bile and froth and hatred where it doesnt belong. We need stricter animal rights laws. This guy tortured and killed these kittens for fun because he was bored. BORED WTF?!? Imagine what this criminal would do if he was bored and had access to a child instead of a kitten??He needs to be locked up and away from our society. People like him don't belong.Yeah this is a case of the punishment doesn't fit the crime. According to the law what he did isn't even that bad. I'd be suprised if he even got 3 years in prison.That doesn't really sound at all fun.I hope he gets a decent jail sentence. Too many people get slaps on the wrists for hurting animals. And it's been shown time and time again, a precursor to a human abuser/murderer is torturing animals. Lock his ass up. "Charged". fuck that. This should read "Man found dead after...".The Middle East is that way --&gt;Ha..it really is from here. 4 chan is triangulating your position now Wasn't he captured?Do they stone people who torture animals there? If so, good for them.I'm pretty sure they only stone women and Christians over there.Have you ever visited the UAENo one is executed over murdering an animal -_-"Glad you don't make the laws &gt; Glad you don't make the lawsMy comment has nothing to do with laws. You're right, man.Cause the best way to teach people that there's no pleasure in violence, is to get violent retribution as people cheer. Right?&gt; is to get violent retribution as people cheer.     Nope. No audience required, just problem solving.     Most intelligent people know where animal cruelty ends. Does animal cruelty end before or after your cheeseburger?Right in the middle with the cheese and bacon.No audience, no body, no trial, no shits given.  fuck emWhere does it end?If only this man had attended a class telling him animal abuse is wrong. This all could’ve been avoided!I like the way you think. These headlines today are making me illSerial killer undergrad. Put him down just like any other rabid dog that shows violent tendencies. At the very least he needs to be castrated, which should slow him down a bit in his violence. You don't "get better" with a mentality like this. He will hurt other people.Tell him that all charges have been dropped due to lack of evidence and that he is free to go. Tell him all his friends are holding a special party to celebrate his release. Then, do [something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlQCW02Tbxc).I know it's just as inhumane as what this "person" did, but when you do stuff like this to animals. I honestly don't care what happens to you in jail. I lose all empathy. Scumbag. He will get 1 maybe 3yrs max. They don't punish people enough for this shit. I'm sure the judges would love to give sick fucks like this 15yrs, but it sadly isn't possible at this moment.If he was a native of Milford this is not that surprising. Worked with a guy from Milford who we had believing that Helen Keller was the first US woman to walk on the moon.Time to get medieval up in hereWhat's really fucked up is the way some people think that if you *don't* do shit like this, it's because you're afraid. Of kittens? Who the hell is afraid of kittens?I'm not! And I can prove it...Saw his hands and feet off.I don't want to read the article but I'm sure jail, or short term prison time (is he going to either of those?) will be tons of fun for him if they find out what he did.Some people just deserve to be kicked in the face. With cleets. Steel tipped if possible.what a shitloaf... i hope he rots.He obviously wants the D and not little a puss.... what a bastard!!!! Plenty of people would love kittens Shocked he isn't from FloridaSerial killer in the making right here folks... What a monster. This world, let alone this country has got some really sick people... I vote for trial by combat in a cage vs. a tiger.Nah that's too nice. Get Ramsay Bolton on the phoneI hope he gets killed in prison.You do that with bowling balls, not cats.What a piece of human garbage.What the fuck, let this trash rot in jail for the rest of his life Reminds me of the story of some village in China where they throw live dogs into boiling water, like lobsters. (I assume they eat boiled dogs).Really sick, but I started thinking about the way humans raise cows and chickens to eat. Not kind, but nothing close to boiling dogs alive. Skin this bastard alive![deleted]I thought the title meant he burned and threw them against a wall like a fiery furball, but they were separate acts.Also, I find it interesting the disconnect between killing a kitten and killing something like a deer, hog, etc.. As if a deer running off with a mortal wound is any less horrible for the creature than burning or slamming against a wall, or eating it somehow makes killing it acceptable in legalese.FWIW, I'm not a vegan or pita or any of that stuff. Just an observation.Most hunters go for clean kills.Hogs are invasive to the united states. Their corpses help the environment more then them living.Deer. Not so much. I just hope the hunter eats them or finds something else to eat them.Also, nothing should die by fire. It's an awful way to go.Yeah, that all makes sense.It's just interesting to me to hear the justifications for things in this realm. Like the hogs thing you mentioned. Humans are the worst creature on the planet in terms of environmental hazards, so from that pov we should just off ourselves. Not saying I believe that we should, but that following certain thought trains just auto-exempts humans even though we're pretty terrible for the environment almost always.Humans see ourselves as above animals. For example, a three year old vs a critically endangered silverback gorilla. Humans considered the three year old's life more valuable.Kittens are effectively helpless and depend on either a human or another cat to survive. Deer and hogs breed out of control (we hunted their natural predators to the brink of extinction) and if left unchecked will destroy the ecosystem.IOW one needs human intervention to survive, the others need human intervention to ensure everything else survives.
Their not counting the fake accounts, just blaming it on third party apps.  Seems like they know shits gonna start hitting the fan with all the recent news and they are trying to get out in front of it with half stories in hopes people will just leave it at that.Not a good day for Twitterhttp://thehill.com/policy/technology/357343-twitter-didnt-tell-senate-intel-about-rt-pitch-to-buy-election-adswhat about Facebook?   I was chatting with the tech geeks at my company last week.  He showed me that the biggest traffic to non-work-related websites out of my company's network was to Amazon.com. More than 3000 requests to Amazon.com each work day. (not surprising)   However, very few people access Facebook during work these days. Traffic to Facebook is down to just under 100 requests each day.  My company has no restrictions on using computer to visit random stuff.  (my company has 1100 employees at this one location)   Now that I think about it, very few of my co-workers use Facebook anymore.  Not sure if it's because most of us are old geezers over the 45-55 age group...Most people use Facebook on their phones since they know their employers are watching their work PCs.I can use Amazon without logging in. I can't use Facebook without logging in. Difference. I don't want to input my Facebook credentials into a machine I don't own, so I just use my phone.What about your phones? I stick to the facebook app on my phone rather than work pc. Because Facebook is/has been shit for a decadegood point...  maybe we should all go back to using MySpaceyeah... apparently they are still in business...Myspace is used by a lot of small music acts now. I miss the good old days of MySpace.But we're totally telling the truth *this* time!Isn't free market capitalism so rewarding... to the psychopaths that run businesses. Not to us regular people. Nah, fuck us.How are you hurt by this? Are the majority of your investments in Twitter because of them misleading you on their monthly users? Do you do advertising on their platform based on their figures? How are you hurt by this?&gt; How are you hurt by this?Why do you careYou are sarcastically criticizing freemakets because "psychopaths run businesses" and are citing Twitter's reporting of user statisics. I just don't see how you can logically come to that conclusion unless you have a financial stake in the company.So do you? If not, why are you this upset about Twitter's reporting? Do you think the government needs to step in and regulate how Twitter counts users?You seem overly invested and way too emotional to have a discussion involving facts. If you are not keen enough to understand what it means when a publicly traded company with no assets lies about the only thing that can come close to being an asset, we just don't have a future in having a good discussion.Would Twitter exist without capitalism?would any of this?we'd have soup, at least...Not potato soup. Ask Latvia!No soup for you!If you wonder why this surfaces now, it might be because they just shut down Digits (the source of the extra users). Therefore, they may have discovered it now since Digits was no longer contributing its active users to Twitters metrics. Just my guess, however.Why guess, it's written in the article:&gt;The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used DigitsTwitter going belly up would not be the worst thing to happen. Isn't that called defrauding investors? So Twitter committed fraud...No wonder Trump loves Twitter. Both full of shit.
*Musk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico's Gov.

More great work by Tesla here.typical day for elonI dunno, this kinda seems like his hobby on the weekend compared to the Gigafactory and firing off rockets with 1.8 million pounds of thrust. Seriously, this is only like 5 minutes worth of production capacity for the Gigafactory. Its that large. You litterally have to use a slow motion camera to even see the batteries passing through some of the machines. People are seriously underestimating how much Tesla and SpaceX do on a typical day. Gigafactory so large that it's not even finished being constructed. The production capacity isn't even fully reached.I hear they are having trouble with the secret lair under that corner of the factory. That's why he had to make a tunnel boring company. Elon is an evil genius. Of course, he has an underground lair.Nah. He just needs a place to store all of his Iron Man suitsElon is better then that.If Elon invented a power source that had enough power to fly a person at super sonic speed and power multi megawatt blasts, he's get it on the marker so everyone can have cheap power.It's a front for a secret Mole People operation He's gotta have somewhere to safely test his Ironman suit. Hopefully not over the priceless cars like in the movie, though.Odd are he has the suit all done the issue is the power source for it thus the giga factory.

I've sincerely started thinking about when i'm going to buy a model 3 (hopefully in the next 3 years) and when I bring it up with a lot of people they tend to belittle him/them.

In America we seem to somehow equate success with lack of sleep. If you look at the studies this seems to be incorrect. businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleeps-6-hours-a-day-2017-3Some people need less sleep. It's a genetic thing. Part of the reason why people associate success with a lack of sleep is because many, though not all, successful people tend to be genetic freaks with respect to their mental abilities (ability to do sustained work, intelligence, creativity, social skills, etc)Quality of sleep seems to have more to do with cycles than total length of time, anyways. 6 hours would be fine if that's your body's cycle and you're waking up naturally at the end.

If this guy said his next project was world peace we'd have it within 20 years.Elon Musk is the hero we need, but don't deserve.Don't sell yourselves short, you've deserved him.I'd say he's earned his "atta boy" for today.He really does seem like a good dude.&gt; As for who's paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells *Nuevo Dia* that for now, it's a donation.[*El Nuevo Día*'s story (in Spanish) explains what that actually means.](https://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/empresas/nota/teslasolarfacilitasistemaparaenergizarelhospitaldelnino-2368514/) I'll translate the relevant bit:&gt; &gt; [The Hospital's Executive Director, María] López explained that Tesla's donation is at no cost and for an indefinite amount of time, until the country's energy crisis is resolved.  After that, she added, the parties would negotiate an agreement for the permanent acquisition of the system, for which they would require contributions from foundations and individuals who financially support or wish to so support the Hospital.Tesla hopes to be paid, but later.**EDIT:** To be clear, none of this is meant as a criticism of Tesla.  It's perfectly rational to limit the immediate donation to the thing that will aid the recipient in their most critical, immediate needs—in this case it's literally about keeping sick children alive—and then revisit later whether to donate more.  Consider that:1. Congress might end up indirectly footing the bill for this equipment;2. Tesla can always opt to donate more than they already have later;3. Later donations might benefit from better information that makes them more effective.You know how people sometimes talk cynically about tax breaks for charity donations, saying things like "Oh, [rich person] donated to charity to get a tax break?"  Non-cynical, charitable people think of it this way: "Nice, a tax break means I can donate more than I otherwise could!"  Likewise, the non-cynical take on this is that Tesla *ought* to wait and see if the government will help pay for this equipment.Of course, if the donations don't come in, he can always repo ... but by then power will be ON.It looks like it's temporary anyway, blocking a parking lot.Does it make sense for Tesla to do this for free forever?  Tesla won't be looking to get paid for what they're doing right now.  &gt; Does it make sense for Tesla to do this for free forever?It certainly makes sense for them to *at least* wait and see if there's a chance they can later get paid from Congressional funding for Puerto Rico recovery.  Basically at this point they've only donated labor and possibly shipping.I'll say this: there's very little in this story so far that makes me look at it cynically.  In and of itself, there's nothing wrong with them giving only as much as they have right now, because:1. What they've given so far is what will most benefit the recipients for their very critical short-term needs;2. They can later choose to give more, when they have more information that enables better choices.About the only cynical comment that I think is merited is that Tesla benefits from the false public perception that they've helped more than they actually have.&gt;About the only cynical comment that I think is merited is that Tesla benefits from the false public perception that they've helped more than they actually have.But there is no false perception here. They've come in and provided power when the hospital had none. What happens with the equipment after primary power is restored is still in the air. From the install pictures it is obviously a temporary install. So, I don't see anything that's being misrepresented about what was done.Well, if Trump's initial reaction and comments are any indication, Puerto Rico is already fixed and needs no funding. It’s just coming out of the advertising budget. Spend money to make money and what does Puerto Rico have to lose?Suck it Zuckerberg.[deleted]It's like unprotected sex. For now it's a donation, later it will be a court-ordered monthly fee.[deleted]Tesla won't give them free power forever. Lost a bit in translation. He said something akin to they can use it free until power is back on. Then they hope to get donations to pay for it to stay.It looks like it's temporary anyway, blocking a parking lot. So it'll need to be moved when power comes back on.Well it's no roll of paper towel but I guess it will do. They'll need them to keep the panels running efficiently.But whose going to throw then onto the roof?Is Trump free? Or does he have a tee time scheduled already Yeah, this situation shines a big ole spotlight on the differences between these two businessmen.  One is a billionaire (?) who started off with inherited wealth, and then made a lot more money by scamming investors, refusing to pay contractors, and allegedly forming ties with criminal organizations.  Despite having the resources of the United States government at his back, the best display of support for the Puerto Ricans he could come up with was to throw paper towels at them.The other is a self-made billionaire and tech magnate who appears to genuinely want to make the world a better place.  In only a few weeks, his company used solar power technology to restore power to a children's hospital.Comparing Donald to Elon Musk really is like comparing paper towels to solar panels./r/cars could give us a long list of reasons why the paper towel was better than teslaTesla donated it. Really nice work Tesla &amp; team, and nice decision by Mr. Musk. Glad they pushed back their Semi reveal event to focus on what matters. Sure it's a PR move, but nontheless a great service to those affected in Puerto Rico. Curious what kind of power consumption requirements the hospital needs and what's being provided, but still less than 3 weeks after a tweet they have much needed power and the means to store it. &gt; Tesla donated it.I suspect you may have missed the precise scope of Tesla's donation.  From the article:&gt; &gt; As for who is paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells *Nuevo Dia* that for now, it's a donation — and that after the energy crisis is over, a deal could make it permanent.[The original story at *El Nuevo Día* (in Spanish)](https://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/empresas/nota/teslasolarfacilitasistemaparaenergizarelhospitaldelnino-2368514/) explains this in much more detail (my translation):&gt; &gt; [The Hospital's Executive Director, María] López explained that Tesla's donation is at no cost and for an indefinite amount of time, until the country's energy crisis is resolved.  After that, she added, the parties would negotiate an agreement for the permanent acquisition of the system, for which they would require contributions from foundations and individuals who financially support or wish to so support the Hospital.So Tesla apparently installed it for free and is lending the equipment for free as well for now, but they clearly ~~expect to be~~ hope they might be paid later. **EDIT:** To be clear, none of this is meant as a criticism of Tesla.  It's perfectly rational to limit the donation to the thing that will aid the recipient in their most critical, immediate needs—in this case it's literally about keeping sick children alive— and then revisit later whether to donate more.  Consider that:1. Congress might end up indirectly footing the bill for this equipment;2. Tesla can always opt to donate more than they already have later;3. Later donations might benefit from better information that makes them more effective.The obvious thing you've missed is that payment discussion surrounds the continuing use of the equipment into the future.  They're still doing it for free now and not indicating they'll bill for it later.I've edited my comment to say "hope" instead of "expect," which I think (hope?) accommodates your point.  The hospital my sister works at is relatively large hospitalin Chicago and uses a 16 cylinder Electromotive diesel (I was able to see it through the ventilation Louvers in the parking garage). I have a similar EMD engine at my nuclear power plant for running high pressure core spray system and it generates up to 2.5 Mw continuous. It depends on the size of the hospital. Plus only essential loads are typically on the generator, a lot of stuff wouldn’t be if it isn’t for critical patient care like ventilators and monitoring equipment. &gt; Sure it's a PR moveNot every company is agile enough to make this decision and make it happen. They get a lot of credit for recognizing the Win/Win and moving. This is real hero work, not just Elon for making/approving the plan. But, everyone who put boots on the ground.All this humanitarianism makes me want to reveal my semi. Wow, companies stepping up where governments fail.Long Live Tesla RicoThis is basically where we are heading.  It's exactly what Republicans want and it makes for a poor system of governance.  i wonder if people will be conflicted because it was a business doing it, but it was an elon musk business I think people are just glad it happened. Everyone has already expressed their dissaproval of the governments response.*puts on tinfoil hat*I wonder if this is all a show, so that the rest of the world steps up to the plate on things like the paris accord and not relying on the US for aid/defence.I mean, the ones who even potentially *could* put on that show would be most interested in that *not* happening.  But it's still probably a decent idea.  It's very irritating to have a party focused on totally jamming up the government then pointing at said government jam up and saying " see how bad government works!"If you're in the UK or keep up with their news, we're seeing this happen right now with the NHS. It's shameful that we can see it happen, point to it happening, talk about it, know the future consequences, but yet not stop it from happening.  For every bill gates or elon musk you have 100 Donald trumps&gt;  It's exactly what Republicans want and it makes for a poor system of governance.Well no, what Republicans *exactly* want is their ol' buddy's two-man company to get a no-bid contract for hundreds of millions of dollars for something that certainly can't be done for that amount or by two people.  Someone coming in and Doing It Right without their cronies getting to skim off the top is their nightmare, (see also broadband competition).As for being a system of government, rich mavericks lying in California distributing infrastructure is no way to run a government.&gt; rich mavericks lying in California distributing infrastructure is no way to run a government.You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!I mean, if I went around saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!That's not what Republicans want, that's what politicians of all types want. &gt; and it makes for a poor system of governanceDoes it?  I've worked on government projects before.  If they were even half as efficient as Tesla, the country would be a far better place. It does when it comes to things like the military, education or prisons.  Basically anything where pure pursuit of profit hurts the goals of the endeavor.Tesla seems to be the exception to a lot of company stereotypes. Imagine the worst case scenario. Someone like Comcast being responsible for our roads, police, and fire departments.A company like Comcast is where it is today due to government, so...&gt; Tesla seems to be the exception to a lot of company stereotypeshttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/elon-musk-tesla-wages-apologyIt may be where Puerto Rico’s heading, but they’re not there yet. This was a donation. Representative government can live on through stock purchases, amirite?I mean sure that sounds great because it’s Tesla but doesn’t that seem inherently bad if companies does things the government should be doing?Kind of like in Robocop when a corporation took over Detroit’s police force right?Edit- double words&gt; Kind of like in Robocop when a corporation took over Detroit’s police force right?Exactly like that.Honest questions:  Why is it inherently bad if companies do it?   Why should the government be doing it?  What exactly should the government be doing that companies are doing?It's generally considered the government's responsibility to handle disaster recovery.  Companies aren't going to do this generally, their job is to make a profit, not work for free. And Red Foreman was the toughest gangster in the city.That's kind of sad.Is Tesla capable of doing the repairs the gov't just awarded the other company the $300m contract to do? The other company just consisted of two guys hiring lots and lots of contractors. Since Tesla can hire contractors, they can do at least as well as the other company.So the 10/10 government response didn't include restoring power to children's hospitals? Huh. How about that.I hope it really is "the first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico," and it's not just Whitefish Energy and subcontractors.Whitefish Energy's two man crew were doing perfectly fine on Carson's 100 year timeline until Musk just swoops in to steal their thunder. Sad!I feel torn. This is what our government should be doing. I don't like the corporate sponsorship. I am glad however that Tesla has stepped it up in Puerto Rico's time of need. Holy fuk - that wasn't even a week, was it?Less than three.&gt;Musk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico's Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted on Oct. 6, "Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities."In the past 3 weeks I've...hmmI did laundry at least twice, so there's that.Look at Mr. Fancy Pants over here with his clean clothes.That's what makes his pants fancy! Actually, both times were 20 and 19 days ago, so no not really.Look at Mr. Rich Fancy Pants over here with his clothes.Twice? You need to invest in a bigger laundry basketFUCK. today is my assigned laundry day. I don't want to do it :(Thanks for reminding meYou've gotta keep that purple top clean.He clearly has some sort of time machine or wolverine thing going on, because [he was mentioned in a Novel by rocket Scientist Wernher Von Braun 18 years before he was supposedly born](https://i.imgur.com/65YR89H.png)Henceforth, Elon Musk shall be known and referred to as The Elon. someone give him control of the nasa so he can get to mars next yearHe's already leading the way to Mars.  Controlling NASA won't help with that. This is great news for Puerto Rico, Elon is a great guy, hope we see more of his great accomplishments in the future. Looks like they are going to need a new parking lot.It's a children's hospital. Children don't driveIf there's one thing Tesla is really good at, it's .... Public imaging.  Elon Musk for President!Of Earth?Of course, [because the leader of Mars is not called President.](https://i.imgur.com/65YR89H.png) That book was written 18 years before he was born.What book is it?["The Mars Project"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Project) by famous Rocket Scientist Werner Von Braun. The book is still highly regarded today due to how uncannily accurate much of the technical information was. He wrote it 5 years before man even got to space, and 16 years before Apollo landed on the moon using his rockets. Yet its more accurate than many books you could pick up today on the same subjects. The guy really was an incredible visionary. The Mars Project by good ol Nazi Rocket boy Wernher von Braun. sure, it would speed of the process of everything he's trying to accomplish The head of Richard Nixon might have a problem with that. The head of richard nixon can bite our shiny metal arses.No thanks, he's doing more good as CEO of his companies than he could ever hope for as president. Yeah, he takes a lot of shit for missing deadlines, or production goals... what people fail to realize is that he REALLY doesn't care about the money.  He sees the money as a tool that allows him to accomplish his almost insane goal of saving the human race from itself...There are not a lot of people like him, and investors should beware investing in his companies because he will burn them if it means achieving his goals... I feel like anyone who hasn't realized that by now deserves to lose that investment though.That being said, I trust him a whole lot more then I do most government agencies, especially at the moment.&gt;what people fail to realize is that he REALLY doesn't care about the money.LOL.. I love people on the internet who think they have any idea what motivates Elon Musk.Seriously, do these guys have a script? I’ve seen similar nonsensical rants on almost every Elon post that gets circlejerked to the front page.Is this a new copypastahttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/25/tesla-firings-spread-across-solarcity-employees-blindsided.htmlSurprising... he runs a business as a business.But that said, I wouldn't want large swathes of government employees suddenly fired.  His type of management works much better in the private sector.You're right. I own a business. Anyone who says that they want to "run government like a business" doesn't know shit about business *or* government.Yes, businesses cut costs by reducing waste. But they also maximize profits for stakeholders to the extent that customers -- and the competition -- will let them.A government run like a business would take all but your first $12K or so in taxes, and have the whole country eating dogfood and living in hovels, because that "business" would be an absolute monopoly. Basically, the country would be nothing but nearly homeless Comcast customers working in slavery conditions. Oh, and a huge military.I guess you can say that as long as you don't actually have to work for the guy. Good thing no one has to work for him. Again, I hate to be captain obvious but **he's not Qualified as an Immigrant**.   Yea, the guy everyone looks up to for dragging this country into the 21st century is an immigrant Just like Albert Einstein,Ieoh Ming Pei,Madeleine Albright,John Muir,Joseph Pulitzer,Felix Frankfurter,Hakeem Olajuwon,nikola tesla,Wernher von Braun edit: Doh, spelled captain wrong. I think most people know he's an immigrant, I can't really think of anyone who has a problem with legal immigration.Have you seen the GOP immigration proposals? [most slash legal immigration levels as well](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/344924-trump-gop-senators-unveil-measure-to-cut-legal-immigration)People who have problem with illegal immigration also have problem against legal immigration. Its just that they can get more people to agree with their bullshit of they feign not being xenophobic and racist. Their end goal is to ban all no white and remove all non whites. Even whites if they aren't the right kind of white such as gay whites, women, non-Christian, socialist, progressive, liberal, etc. Am I reading that wrong or do you claim that if you're against illegal immigration you're automatically against legal immigration too?_Most_ people  have problem with illegal immigration also have problem against legal immigration. My dad is as conservative as Trump when it comes to illegal immigration, but my mom is a legal immigrant, green card and all, and my dad wants it to be easier for people to immigrate legally. And my mom is a woman, an agnostic, and a leftist. I so love how he uses business to achieve his goals for humanity. All his companies, his innovations, his profits are a big ploy to get to Mars faster. So contrasting with wall street filled with soulless self-centred money hoardersIt's no use Elon, we see through your propaganda. Can we please fast forward to the big reveal where you're the Big Bad?E......hum........eh. I have to go... my batteries are empty... I'm parked double...I mean fuck you!elon pulled a kevin durant All the power to him.No no no. All the power is coming _from_ him.Time to start planning for the invasion and annexation of South Africa.Can't be.  Doesn't qualify.Real shit, Musk is a hero/person I look up to.Why did they turn it off in the first place??  /sStuff like this helps reinforce my choice of going with Tesla for my solar.How do you feel about hyperloop? I want it to work but I don't know that it will. I'll remain both skeptical and hopeful. Even if it fails at least there is some forward thinking.I ahve solar, go it a couple of years ago.I did  moths of research finding out the status of Solar Shingles.No one had squat outside of a few piece in test labs. 18 months after my panels go up, Solar Shingles go on the market.God damn it. Does anyone know how many powerwalls they had to install? The solar during the day is one thing but being able to store the load for an entire hospital overnight is impressive.They didn't use the Powerwalls here, they use [Powerpacks](https://www.tesla.com/powerpack), which is their large business and grid storage solution. And from what I'm understanding they have 500 kWh of storage and each powerpack has 210 kWh. And not that long ago 3 Powerpacks were spotted coming into Puerto Rico, so probably about 2 and 1/2 Powerpacks worthWHAT?  Musk did something that some kind of President wasn't able to do?There's been much more federal aid and reconstruction than powering on a single hospital. It doesn't make for exciting headlines, but it's been happening and continues to happen every day. It was one hospital. FEMA has electrified many more hospitals than that on faster timelines over the last few years. I know you’re foaming at the mouth trying to find a reason to hate on Trump but there are a lot of hardworking people in FEMA working on the situation and a lot of hardworking politicians like Trump that fought hard to extend FEMAs budgetary tolerances. Get a grip.The president wasn't willing to do it .He's not capable either.Elon Musk for president 2024?Who do you want for 2020? Buy Tesla stock now, he'll bring power to Africa and the rest of the world too.I wish he could be our president. That would take him away from his work.  I'd rather have him right where he is now.And Trump takes credit in 5. 4. 3. 2..."Our people have made a great accomplishments. Ask the failing tmz.com how Tesla got their visas fastly and expedited. Ask the very bad terrible nYtimes why Corker is a commie."Actually the most significant thing here is it's proof of concept of rapid deployability of a temporary or permanent large scale solar/battery power system. The part about this that worries me is the possibility of Trump's donor who got the contract to rebuild PR's infrastructure, could come in and destroy all that work Musk and Tesla put in. why did he turn it off in the first place? fucking dickI read this as, "Tesla turns back on..." I was sort of happy because I dislike Musk. Not for any legitimate reason. I am just jealous he's smart and handsome.You know the Republicans are going to use this as an argument for "the free market" and privatization, not as the colossal failure of government that tends to result when they are in power.Yes it's obviously a Republican MO to gain power solely for the purpose of fucking up government so they can justify selling it off to private companies.THat's some beautiful PR right there. ALso, good job Elon and his crew!The only thing waging a 'War on Coal' is Capitalism.I need every single mother fucker who said that Trump had a fine response to the crisis and how it was a complex situation and they can't just get power up and running again after the hurricane to step forward and admit they were wrong. One company returned power to a hospital in 3 fucking weeks.This is exactly right.  You won’t get one response from them though...Do they keep flicking the power on and off? Or are there just a bunch of threads on the same instance?"Get me a 24/7 guard on that switch, dammit!"That would be so cool if Tesla and solar city rebuilt their entire grid as a model for the rest of the world. Of course there would still be other forms of power, but it would really give us an idea of what could he done. Hooray for free market capitalism!Even as a Musk hater I find it hard to not admire this.Musk is the motherfucking man!Elon Musk is a true hero....Tesla, doing what America won't.So no other hospital on PR has had power restored? Well America didn't restore *this one's* power now did it.Everybody here is talking about the fact that you'd struggle to park there now.I'd rather my child be able to breathe and be warm than be able to park.This is bullshit. Blatant discrimination against the coal industry. Everyone knows coal is where it’s at!  And don't even get me started on the Whitefish energy bullshit, that is corruption incarnate
Smart kid. Better to be hurt than damaged or dead. According to Kenbridge Police Chief Raymond Hite, 26-year-old Eric Donte Harrison of 49 Busy Lane, north of Kenbridge off of Blackstone Road, has been charged with Abduction With Intent To Defile and Use Of A Firearm In Commission Of A Felony. Harrison, who last year resided on Circle Drive, Lawrenceville, is being held without bond at Piedmont Regional Jail in Farmville.https://www.courier-record.com/news/kenbridge-boy-escapes-captormore information here with interview with the kid and dad.. what a scary ordeal. I'm glad for the happy ending. http://wset.com/news/local/police-boy-escapes-abduction-by-jumping-out-of-moving-vehicle-suspect-arrestedMad respect, bruh - that was some scary stuff.A parent's worst nightmare.  Glad he's okay.Totally kick ass. 12? And who even knows how many kids he saved by exposing this guy. Pussy. Kid should have choked the guy outDid you see how thick the neck is of that fat pedo? Thank god that kid escaped.When will the black on black violence end...Racism is an issue, and people rightfully  make a big deal out of it. But holy shit. Black on black violence is something else. It is by **far** the number one cause of homicides within the black community.Why? Because of gang violence. Because of exposure to the ghetto. And that's the **real** issue that has attenuated in the media since its peak in the 1990s. Username checks out 
So instead of being stuck in Boston traffic in the dark, we get to be stuck in Boston traffic as the sun goes down like a carrot on a stickHow about we just introduce 4 hour work days instead, that would be great...I'd even switch to 4 10s, or even just 3 12s I used to work three 12s. It was glorious. Yeah, I would definitely take that loss of 4 hours right now if I could switch to 3 12s. Having 4 days off would be amazing. Great for the employees, not so great for the business. Nothing is worse for business than when a potential customer/client calls and you're not open to receive the call.Isn't that why they tend to stagger the 4 10s and 3 12 schedules?Well, yeah. In my case that's why it will never happen. It would ruin our availability. But I can dream... They just have to do it correctly. I'm currently working 3 on 4 off 4 on 3 off schedule. Which means I work wed-friday 12 hours one week and then wed-sat 12 hours the next week on night shift. I work as a customer service rep and our customer service runs 24/7 minus holidays. The management just needs to figure out the schedule to make it work. It has actually enhanced our availability surprisingly.The shift my company does is a 3 and 4 day rotation. So the one shift will be Sunday to Wednesday and the next be Sunday to Tuesday. Sundays are 10 hour days so it's still 80 every 2 weeks. And then there is the opposite shift that doesn't Wednesday to Saturday and Thursday to Saturday. Been on it for 9 years and it's a best shift ever. I truly believe not getting up 5 days a week for work is what prevents me from burning out.Lucky bastard. I had to do the DuPont schedule. 24 hours one week 60 the next with every other weekend off. Th 24 was great. The 60 sucked ass. I do 4 9s for 90% salary. It's great. Totally worth the 10% pay cut. I'm working on an ms in cs concurrently, do the extra day off helps a lot.As someone who works 10-12h without a break for 5 days, cutting down to 4 and getting a break would be nice. *sigh*I would be happy if they would stop the daylight savings hour change.This is even worse, IMHO.Ever try to drive on the Pike with the sun in your face?NH here. No. We're not afraid of the dark.You still have Daylight Saving time.  So in essence, yes you are.I don't miss the sun coming up at 7:30 then going down at 4:15 in the winter there.Of course not. If you were, you'd be part of Canada.So lemme get this straight.In New Hampshire it'll be 1pm.. I drive directly south (*across the state line*) and its now 2pm.. and then if I drive south again into Connecticut its 1pm again. And if I go west into NY state its also 1pm. Ya, that wont fuck things up. /sI'm from NH, and I'm pretty sure we said we'd switch if Maine and Mass also switch. Yeah I believe the recommendation is only moving forward with it if most/all of NE adapts the change.&gt;But there is some fine print. The report said Massachusetts should not act alone, or else it could disrupt "commerce, trade, interstate transportation and broadcasting" across the region. A majority of other states in New England would have to jump on the time-zone train, too.Yes, its like no read the article. &gt; Yes, its like no read the article.Well, this IS Reddit^^I^didn't^read^it^eitherI'm from VT and this is giving me a headache.It'll be like driving through Arizona.We don't need to save daylight. We get so much But out on the rez they do save daylight.  So does NM.  Everyone else is wrong. Pick one and stay there, and as a night person, I prefer you pick the one that makes it so the sun doesn't set at 4 PM in the winter, even if it means the sun stays up till 11PM in the summer. No, it would be like driving from Arizona to Utah.I think the idea would be to switch all of New England, so it'd only change once you get to NY. Trouble is convincing CT, considering how many people there work in New York.CT, Vermont, and western Mass. all are "borderline".  Massachusetts and CT could both have their western edges split.On the other hand, if commuting to NYC you can leave an hour later.  That might occasionally come in handy with kids and their schedules.Also Long Island stretches out....pretty darned far.  Maybe the Hamptons would do it just to separate themselves from the rest of NY.Well, duh. CT is basically New York. new york would go with it, despite not being "new england".  It would be silly to have the largest financial center in the US waking up an hour after the workday has begun.[deleted]Wouldn't it be 12 in the midwest, 1 in Cleaveland, and 2 in New England? Unless I'm missing something about Cleaveland.No I took some cold medicine this morning and am retarded. My mistake.The article specifically says that it was recommended they only make the change if other new england states did as well.  Oh, the article is the thing you can read if you actually click the big title up at the top, and generally provides a whole bunch more information.You'll be saving time?"I'll be there 30 minutes ago."But when will it be now? Right now. Too late, right now has come and gone.We're looking at now now. Everything that's happening now is happening now. When will then be now?If it helps at all, it'll actually be the same time regardless of what time it will be.I live in Arizona. For half the year we're in a different time zone than the rest of the mountain time zone states. You get used to it fast.NH and ME would switch in a heartbeat if Boston did.Arizona doesn't observe daylight savings and the southwest is doing fine Well, is it? Let us ask New MexicoIndiana used to have I think 4 different "time zones".  Eastern and Central tzs- but only some of each followed daylight savings.There was a good West Wing episode on it.Only if you drive really fast.If you read it, you would know that its only happening if all of new england switches. What kind of schmuck ass system can this possibly be!?How do, how do...  I don't understand.  How do buses run?What do ... what do ... what do ... do people... they just, they just reset their watches when they commute??They just change their watches every time they cross a time zone?!?WHAT IS THIS A JOKE?!?!I wish we could just stay on permanent Daylight Saving Time. I hate pushing the clocks ahead in the fall. It's so depressing.edit: push the clocks back, I mean (thank you [u/mrperson0!](https://reddit.com/u/mrperson0) )You push clocks back in the fall.We all observe Daylight Saving Time in our own way.do people really care this much about it? Do you really *"hate"* it? It's pretty uh, ineffectual in my life. Am I in the minority? I don't even notice half the time now, since my cellphone automatically switches. Personally, yes, I really hate it. Having the sun go down before 5pm in winter in NY honestly sucks the life outta me, and serves no purpose to anyone.Just put on Seger's "Night Moves" and stock up on cheap red wine. It going down before 6 instead of before 5 doesn't make much of a difference to me since I'm not home til 6:30 anyway.It's not the actual changing the clocks, it's how earlier darkness makes you feel. This takes at most 2 days to adjust to for me, and I'm usually appreciative of the extra sun on whichever end it's being added to. It's one hour, not like you changed to the night shift or something. I dunno, though, I'm just a guy.I work night shift, so it doesn't really affect me either way. This is essentially switching to permanent DST. I think we should do that anyway everywhere.I think we should leave the clocks where they're at and just adjust when we do things/how long we do things without messing up anyone's internal rhythms.Sounds like a terrible idea; being an island of time will be a logistical nightmare. Why not just shift working hours up by an hour and keep the arbitrary numbers that everything refers to and is based on, the same.Just change business hours if you want to be doing business when the sun is up.Edit: I propose a compromise: forget time zones, lets all use UTC&gt; Why not just shift working hours up by an hour and keep the arbitrary numbers that everything refers to and is based on, the same.Yeah, shifting the work day would be a great way to avoid a logistical nightmare, because nobody crosses a state line to go to work - especially not in those smaller, packed-together northeastern states. &gt; forget time zones, lets all use UTCThat's kind of what China does.  One time zone.  Country is wider than the USA, so if work starts at 8:00 AM, it'll be light on one side of the country and completely dark for hours on the other side.&gt; Sounds like a terrible idea; being an island of time will be a logistical nightmare.&gt; It would not.  Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island would likely all join.  Connecticut would be a question mark, due to their close association with NYC.  &gt; Why not just shift working hours up by an hour and keep the arbitrary numbers that everything refers to and is based on, the same.National companies do not work that way.  They have set hours they often require.  The issue isn't big enough for them to change the hours. These states get so little daylight during parts of the years that wasting time making the timezones of the East into a clusterfuck don't make sense for the tiny benefits they would see.The proposal would include much of New England. So a decent sized Island of time, plus we would Join part of Canada, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.Think of how many changes that would take for every business to change start and end times by one hour.  It would take an email and a flyer in the break room to change times you're doing business.But everyone would have to go along to make it helpful: schools, banks, doxtor’s offices, PTA meetings, last call at the bar. Luckily, there’s a way to make it so everyone will go along: just change the time zone.Everyone is going to have to go along with that too, lol.  Its a lot more complexity for anyone that has contact outside of that time zone.  You're forgetting retail stores, signage, web sites, anything with the hours printed on it.The Maritime provinces are on Atlantic time and we're just on the other side of the northern border to New England. I don't see why it's such a big deal.[Hmm.](https://qntm.org/abolish)That's a wonderful use case of not having time zones.This guy spends a lot of time trying to make it seem like a big fucking deal to figure out what local time is being awakened and everything. The same way you can look up online what time it is currently with time zones you could look up what son up and Sundown times are were "average day times" are in another place.And the age of things like Google make a lot of those complaints useless.The point is not necessarily that it is that much harder; it’s more that it isn’t as obviously superior as one might expect it to be. Solar time and time zone approximations follow our intuition, and instituting a universal time requires to radically alter our intuition for no clear gain. Or, more briefly, the disease isn’t worth curing. Atlantic Time zone seems to work fine in Nova Scotia, not that many people realize it exists.I work in Hartford and we have a ton of employees that commute in from MA. It's a FANTASTIC idea. I wish NY would do it.Or better yet, let's just stop with this Daylight Savings nonsense entirelyKeep the random numbers the same...Keep the random numbers... the same. Keep the random... numbers... the same. Is it a logistical nightmare for Arizona? You just give Mass its own time zone category like they did with AZ. Time zone divisions run north/south. Whether you're in the same time zone with the state to the east or west doesn't matter much. It's the north/south orientation that causes problems. This isn't relevant much in AZ because to the south is another country and to the north nobody really lives in the southern half of Utah. I think the fact that you can cross the state in an hour or two (at least north to south) that makes it an issue since you could very quickly be in another time zone. Or you might live in Mass and work in NH or something like that. Those can be issues in AZ, but they're less likely to be simply because of its size.not a nightmare, but it does unnecessarily complicate things for basically no reason. Arizona is vastly larger than Mass. You're typically driving for at least 8-10 hours until you get to the next state. It also doesn't have its own time zone. Half the year it's in Mountain time, then the country shifts and it goes to Pacific time. The logistical nightmare is pretending to care about daylight savings.Bay Stater here. I would love if all of New England adopted this but for that to happen Massachusetts needs to set the precedent. I don't care if there is a two-five year gap. It would make my life and the lives of all Bay Staters better. Masshole as well, I'd prefer not to. My daily commute to Connecticut would be weird until they caught up, and I don't want to add another hour of time for when I can talk to my family and friends on the West coast.I am originally from California, so I get that. But I suffer from seasonal depression, it has already set in. I leave work at it's barely light out and I get home and the sun as just set. I have three sun lamps too. I think it would benefit everyone. Mass here, I'm all for it.  Spending less time active in the dark in winter months means using less energy to warm businesses, to run the lighting, especially parking lot lighting.  It would make it safer for kids to get to school in the morning, and safer for joggers and walkers.  It will cut driving time in the dark down, which would lower accidents, and not having to do daylight saving time would keep us on the same time year round meaning no sleep schedule problems. It won't happen because we would have to take all of New England with us into this brave new world, and who is going to pay the bribes to get RI to do anything? RI pretty much just adopts Mass's laws 2-5 years later, so we'll catch up if you guys get on it. It's going to make sports fans miserable. It's already effectively impossible for most people to watch Monday Night Football, at this point we're talking about all night games played in the west coast ending at 2am+ for us.Outside of that I don't really care. By 1 hour.  If the NFL wants the viewership of the entire NE they might have to start that game an hour earlier.  or two, depending on Daylight saving time.  If half of your viewership drops off halfway through the game, you need to make an adjustment or the people paying for the commercials will be paying a lot less for second half spots.California alone has triple the population of New England.  You move that game back an hour or two and the entire state will still be at work or commuting home for the first half.  The NFL isn't going to give up viewership of the entire pacific time zone to gain back New England.Inb4 New England is accused of deflating viewsexcuse me, i remember walking to school at 7am in the dark... now you want to make that 8am  Are you flipping nuts!edit:  I screwed that up... converse... you now want to make 4:11pm sunset a 3:11pm sunset.No, you had it right the first time.  They want to make a 4:11pm sunset a 5:11pm sunset.  The idea is to just get rid of DST, and make the summer time permanent.I live in Cincinnati which is 700 miles west of Boston but in the same time zone, so our sunrise/sunset are almost a full-hour later than Boston. You're just trading evening darkness in winter (when you're probably inside anyway) for morning darkness. I moved here from Connecticut ten years ago and 8:00 AM darkness is the only part I still haven't gotten used to. I work outdoors so this time of year I can't even really do anything until 9:00 AM. I don't know how people even further west in Indiana and the UP of Michigan can stand it.  West Michigander here, it's super weird. I moved here from Illinois, slightly more than 100 miles as the crow flies but yet in a different time zone. The mornings right now (before the end of DST) are brutal. Moved from Cleveland to the western half of Indiana a few years ago. The change in daylight hours was surprisingly jarring, and still is to some extent. In the middle of the summer when the days are longest, it's still dusk at 9:30pm. Makes me wish all of Indiana was included in CSTI work near cinci and can't see out of a window at work. In the winter it's dark when I get to work and dark when I leave. It's pretty lame.fellow Masshole here. I agree with the above statement.I knew it! I'm surrounded by Massholes!RI State government has acknowledged that we'd consider switching over but only if Mass does, so like usual we'll be behind at best or at worst completely change our mind with a new administration.They proposal isn't to end daylight savings time, Massachusetts is considering moving to the Atlantic time zone which includes parts of Canada.The shortest amount of daylight Boston gets is in the end of December where the sunrises at 7:10am and sets at 4:10pm.  The timeline means most people go to work/school in daylight and come home in the dark.  If Massachusetts moves to the Atlantic time zone, the sun will rise at 8:10 and set at 5:10.  That would likely increase the number of people commuting in the dark. marty we have to go to the future, one hour to be exact!Waiting on a response from Mayor Walsh...Maine here. I'd love it if they did bc Maine would follow suit. The situation is even worse here. I work a normal 8-4:30 job and it sucks in the winter bc I go to work in the dark to a windowless office, and I go home in the dark. I only get to see sunlight on the weekends. :(Sweet. Will the state move a few miles off shore where the world will be safe from their drivers?have you met NY or CONN drivers?wHaTs tHe DeAl wItH dRiVeRs???Why don't we jump a year ahead? Why can't we just dump timezones and DST all together?No, that's a terrible idea.  Especially for those of us who commute to work from out of state.  NH would most likely switch to whatever MA does.And then Vermont then New York. Before you know it Chicago will be on Greenwich Mean Time!Connecticut will be last because, well, Connecticut. More like TAXECTICUT, RIGHT!??Good. Eliminate one of the least productive days of the yearAlso one of the most deadly since the number of car crashes spikes around the two days of time change a year. Try looking at Indiana. I believe it is up to each county to determine if they observe Daylight savings time or not. I had to go there one time for work. Left one plant location to go to a meeting 15 miles south. And I was late. No one bothered to tell me that the plant to the south was in a different time zone (and an hour ahead). I left at 2:45 for a 3:00 meeting....and arrived at 4:00.Massachusetts, the original American revolutionaries. First, in the 1770s, then tried to secede in the 1810s and here they go again. Trying to drag New England with them as usual. Does nobody read the article? All northeastern states would switch for it to apply, not just one.As someone in CT, I hope they don't do this unless all of NE is onboard. I work in Hartford and we have a lot of employees from MA. That's going to seriously fuck the schedules of anyone that has kids. That's fucking retarded.... Do they not realize how much of a screw up that would cause to everyday travel, planning, and infrastructure?Post digitalization time zones are obsolete.  It is the same time everywhere, there are just different times the day starts depending on where you are.except they won’t do that because it will just complicate business with the rest of the east coastJust dump time zones all together, DST as well. Just have everyone use a 24 hour clock where it is the same time everywhere and you just are not always up at 06:00 everywhere on the planet.Fixes all mix up with time zones and clock changing bullshit.What time Arizona Iowa in?Jonah Ryan is going to get pissed. Good. All of New England should follow and go to the proper time zone.The sun comes up too early. It gets dark at 3:30 in the winter there.In Winter it's either dark or it's white. As a westcoaster, I already have only a 3-hour window to talk to my colleagues on eastern time - and that includes their lunch hour. If New England goes to Atlantic time we'll have *one* hour of overlap in the average workday. Obviously we'd make it work somehow, but it's not fun to think about.An out of towner trying to move in and change the way locals tell time?You can go fuck yourself, Tom. Honestly all of New England should consider this. As someone who had intense S.A.D. there (which magically disappeared when I left for the Left Coast) maybe this really could have significant public health impacts... Everyone I know there is so miserable and pessimistic, especially in the dead of winter, and I'm sure the extra hour in the dark doesn't help... All anecdotal I know, but still... I think it's worth serious consideration.Well except that it doesn’t do what’s claimedIf this has merit, Canada should be in on the discussion given that Quebec City is just north of Boston.The weird thing looking down on the time zone map is Argentina, which is two hours ahead of the Eastern time zone (the whole country is in that zone).  Yet it is west of Brazil and a good portion of the country is, or should be, physically, in the Eastern time zone.  More extreme is China, which has one main time zone for a country that physically spreads across 5 zones.We should all just stay on daylight savings time permanently Redzone would start at 9AM on the east coast instead of 10! 9 HOURS OF COMMERCIAL FREE FOOTBALL. I don't get the big deal. I just checked and sunset in Boston is only 15 minutes before sunset in NYC. And Boston is the East most city in Massachusetts. I live in MA and this is a terrible fucking idea. The upside is minimal, Most people have clients or work responsibilities in other states. I can't wait to juggle another time zone when I set a conference call. Sounds impractical. Why not just put the whole state on a raft and float it south in the Atlantic? ;-)I know what will improve the fuckery of time zone difference and DST: Creating even more time zones.Atlantic time zone already exists. I'd like to see the "Too early to call-They probably went home" Time Zone. If everyone out West could stop sending emails at 3pm, their time, wondering if I was taking a late lunch that would be great.This is news? Who cares.IMO the different time zones make things complicated enough as is. If anything we need fewer time zones. what's wrong with just following the time without thinking about daylight? i work in the office so it is not like i need daylight anyway.
This is why theocracy is a horrendous idea. Keep religion out of politics. I don't know if religion is the motivation. I'd tend to guess it's a custom of overt sexism being justified by reference to religion. The judge was justifying it based off of her religious text. It is the only justification that there could have been. Take the book away and this would've clearly been a crime. No, they also claimed the perpetrator was dishonored and because depressed, which I'd bet is their real motivation -- a concern with male honor. People will justify their behavior by referring to high principles, but it's not always the real motivation and seldom the only one.The test is that the Bible prescribes the death penalty for all kinds of things, but you'll never see a judge excusing someone for assaulting someone who defies any other biblical rule.I wasn't talking about his motive. I was directly referencing the judge's decision. They made it very clear that the Bible was a factor in their ruling. The point is that this man was excused and it was the judge who invoked the biblical rule. It's pretty cut and dry that their religious beliefs are absolutely connected to their ruling. Which is pretty fucked up, because it’s not an accurate interpretation of the Biblical rule to begin with, nor is it a Biblical punishment when taken in the context of the entire Bible.  It’s more like this judge cherry-picked one or two verses completely out of context and used them to justify an abhorrent crime.  [removed]Or maybe people shouldn't beat someone half to death for stupid shit. Call her a bitch, break up with her, leave. Do you really think he was justified? did you miss the "ex-" in the headline?Well aren't you just the perfect asshole.  Of course her beating is her fault!Yet if the guy cheated and she cut off his dick, she would be justified? "no" you say? This has already happened and the reddit feminists did just that. Sometimes actions are justified. Not saying this one, as I didn't read the article or anything at all so I have no context on if they were together and she cheated on him in his bed, etc.What about a guy beating another guy up the the walked into fucking his wife? Is that OK? If so, even if the wife is the one doing the betrayal to the husband, that's not? Because she's a woman? If not OK, you then think that no repercussion should be handed out besides a slap of the wrist to someone ruining another's perception of their own life, potentially costing the man his livelihood home, family, etc.?  Emotions should be stifled and the guy should just get over it, not react, and accept that his life is gone and is only allowed to react by being a bitch and walking away? Just curious. Offensive violence as a response to non-violence or a non-threat solves nothing. None of the examples you gave warrant violence at all. The repercussion for a cheating wife is losing her husband and being given the stigma that she deserves: being a shitty person. I'm not saying emotions should be stifled because you're allowed to be angry and hateful - you're just not allowed to beat anyone. Walking away doesn't make you a bitch, it makes you smart.By the way, I was just as disgusted at the story of that woman chopping off her husband's dick. Fuck her and fuck this guy. I'd rather get hit in the face than lose my wife and home, home as well to the wife that cheated on me and somehow still gets the court system on her side. Guess that's just me though. Physical violence isn't always the worst thing someone can do to another person. Just my opinion. Not to sound like someone who hits others though, just saying that I think being cheated on and having your life ruined is a little worse than being hit. And how would getting in a fight prevent you from losing any of that? You'd rather stay with a woman that betrayed you and fucked someone behind your back? What if she doesn't want that? Either way, you'd lose. At least you won't go to jail for assault if you don't initiate violence. You're not wrong. I'm just saying that physical violence isn't inherently worse than non physical. Cheating isn't violence. Edit: I deleted my earlier comment because I mistook you for someone else that I'm replying to on this thread. That's why my comment might not have made sense. Fuck mobile. For the sake of my sanity, I am going to assume you meant to put a /s there.So no real justice then? Maybe he will get what is coming to him anyway.Let's play; "guess the country and religion."Answer: Portugal and Catholocism.Judge's name: Judge Joaquim Neto de Moura.EDIT: I say this not to knock Catholicism, more to point out that hideous sexism and excusing spousal abuse aren't exclusive to Islamic societies, which I'm pretty sure is what was hinted at in the original comment...I mean, my guess was going to be India. I thought Italy. You could kill your wife on the grounds of honor killing until the 80s there. Fucking Italians. Go ahead and knock Catholicism as much as you want. People like to give a free pass for shitting on Islam like it's the only religion with any kind of problem, but Catholicism is responsible for a lot of religious atrocities in the areas they control. Fuck it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with criticizing Catholicism. Absolutely nothing should be above criticism. The bible is a collection of ancient stories written down by men well over a thousand years ago. I will choose believe verifiable scientific fact instead of what some old men dressed in robes tell me to believe. My 9 year old nephew has more scientific knowledge than any of the men who wrote the bibleThere, someone criticized Christianity&gt; There is absolutely nothing wrong with criticizing Catholicism. What's interesting is no one will  screech racist when you do or call you a 'Cathlophobe'. Isn't that interesting.But they will pretend they're victims and say Christianity is under attack.I mean hell, they even do this if you don't proclaim joy in celebrating their holidays. How about that.  Pretty interesting.That's because they often disguise racism against brown people as "criticism of Islam". I'm sure if you criticized black Christians only, you'd also be called a racist (perhaps justifiably). Try criticizing Judaism and not be called anti-semitic. Stop trying to pretend that Islam is specifically being protected somehow, it isn't. You are just overly fixated on it.That's funny because Islam and Catholicism are actually identical. Identical as in they are both complete nonsenseI don't know anyone who says domestic violence and sexism is exclusive to Islam. Literally no one I've ever met, ever.I've met people who think that it's a disproportionate amount though much like Islam seems to have a disproportionate amount international terrorists. And as far as I know I haven't heard the "God says I can" excuse for domestic violence from Christians but I absolutely have heard about it from Muslims.I find it interesting how people are so quick to defend against certain stereotypes but willfully disregard others (e.g. democrats v republicans). In this specific instance people would have guessed wrongly -- but it doesn't make the overall stereotype wrong.Much like how Catholicism has a stereotype of priests and pedophilia.It's portugal and the court cited the Bible in their decision.  I refuse to believe that - or read the article for fear of having to believe thatWas the Portuguese flag not enough?Merica recognizes no flag but merica. (And GB, Russia and Mexico, you know, the important ones)I don't think there are any other flags actually.
Imagine that.An untreated infected wound becomes necrotizing, and suddenly some of the scariest words in the medical lexicon come out to play.Clean and dress your wounds people.  Apply topical antibiotics and keep track of them, *especially* if you're very young, old, or immuno-compromised.  If it's not getting better, go to the doctor immediately.This can happen with *virtually any significant injury*, and it's most often caused by bacteria that already exist on your body.Don't halfass wound treatment, and you've got very little to be afraid of.Honestly with all the chaos in the wake of the hurricane, etc. I'm surprised there haven't been a bunch more cases like this.Honestly that's not something I would even think of happening in the us. Like I know it can happen, just not something I would think about ever.I mean, a Quebec opposition leader had his leg amputated after stubbing his shin on a coffee table and contracting a flesh eating bacteria.I assume that a lot of these people didn't really have time. They just focused on getting out. Doesn't help that even a very, very little cut can turn very bad very quickly. I say this as someone who got very, very sick from a little cut on my foot.Harvey was the first few days of September.He went to the hospital October 10th.  This is well past the "just focus(ing) on getting out" stage.It can take weeks for the infection to get bad. When I had mine, it was about a month as well. I was doing better and then BAM! Infection!Which then took me another few days to realize how bad it was.What about pimple wounds?I had wound on my taint and it stinged so bad i doused it with alcohol and took a hot shower only to make it worse lmao dont try this at home kidsWhat we need in Texas is a racist-eating bacteria.  I’d be ok with that.Meanwhile, there are over a dozen deaths in Puerto Rico from treatable bacterial infections caused by unclean drinking water.Ok? It's not a competition.They just had their whole island wiped out how is this shocking?If the mayor of San Juan and her cronies would quit throwing out the supplies they are being sent and actually distribute them, it could easily be prevented.Trump only cares about his white constituents. Not "Pwerto Wrico"Ummm have you ever been to Houston? It’s not northern Idaho you race baiting moron. Question: If the bacteria that causes such infections common, why are these infections not more common?Because most people tend to clean their wounds before it gets infected. People who die from this is because they dont treat their wounds.
This guy had a girlfriend.  Think about that.r/incels is cryingWhat is that sub about?It’s an abbreviation of “involuntary celibate”, AKA guys who are too creepy/crazy to have sex with women... and think it’s women that are the problem.Thank you for explaining this! I found my way into that sub randomly and I was so confused about everything. Now...it makes so much sense. No problem!And fair warning, don’t even bother wasting any pity on them. They tend to support *really* awful things... like “legalize rape” awful.Man what does it say about my dating life when even cannibal keith is getting some action. Yup, he definitely had a girlfriendIf he can do it, anyone can.  There's someone out there for everyone.  .. to eat.Actually she left him, according to the article he broke into his ex-girlfriend's home when the killing occurredI mean, this was probably his first outburst. He might have presented himself as relatively normal before that point. I doubt he went into that relationship with a sign saying "I will rape you, eat you, kill you, and not necessarily in that order". Meanwhile my sane ass can't get one. I don't even like human meat! A guy who ate his girlfriend is crazy? I'm shocked I tell you, shocked!&gt; Prosecutors allege that Oberhansley broke into the Jeffersonville home of his 46-year-old ex-girlfriend, Tammy Jo Blanton, in September 2014, and that he raped her, stabbed her to death and ate parts of her body.    So it was his ex girlfriend. That doesn't really change much, but it's an important distinction i think. Well he can say goodbye to himself because they will 100% turn him into a zombieFor sure.     &gt; Oberhansley, who faces murder, rape and abuse of a corpse charges, will undergo "competency restoration" treatments in an effort to try him at a later time.    Not exactly sure what competency restoration treatments are, but I have a feeling it involves pumping him full of drugs Competency restoration involves teaching the accused about court practice and procedure so that they can meaningfully participate in a trial. It's a bit more complex than that, but that is the gist of it. The accused has to be able to work with their defense counsel in a courtroom setting.While most mentally ill folks can identify the participants and their roles, they get hung up on abstract concepts like plea bargains.Or if he's like that bus cannibal in Canada they'll decide he's fine after a few years on meds and cut him loose on society.Edit: Downvote me all you want, it's true: http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/manitoba/vince-li-discharge-1.3977278[deleted]I don't recall him being a millionaire, are we talking about the same guy?No I was thinking of the Canadian serial killer. My bad Well to be fair himself isn't probably the type of person we want out and about anyway. But I dig the zombie joke in a thread about a man eating his gf what the literal fuckThis is why I recommend couples not to gift each other bath salts. Ate my girlfriend this morning and all is well with the world pooter pic being sentDid she eat you back?there was nothing left of her. Answer the man's question.good to the laassssst bite.I had mine for breakfast as well.The Midwest lives on a meat-only diet.Great, so the son of bitch will spend a few years in a mental hospital and be released with a new name and no supervision just like the Greyhound Bus cannibal in Canada. These people sure know how to work the system.Yeah the cannibals are real masterminds of gaming the systemI said the same and got downvoted to shit. People don't want to accept the reality: there are some people, whether or not they're in control of their actions, who simply are not safe to be allowed out in society unsupervised.Agree and it's common sense, don't see why it would be downvoted, Hinkley is free too, many don't know that he had rich parents with political connections who were able to get him a really good lawyer. Yet they sure wouldn't want them living in their neighborhood, hypocrites. This is what happens when you show up at somebody's house unannounced and empty-handed. When I make a surprise visit I like to bring along a pizza or maybe a nice casserole. That way if we get the munchies later we're covered. But that's just me.Guy eats his girlfriend and is found incompetent to stand trial......you don't say....more news at 11.So he should just be put down without a trial then right?
Good luck catching himAnd keeping him behind barsAnd in handcuffsOh brotherThis is a job for Penn and Teller.What the F?sounds like HW Bush has the wrong favorite magicianJust Blaine it on his age!Made his weenie disappearWorst magic trick ever."Hides yo wives, hide yo children, they raping errybody up in 'ere!!"A model of what?physical beautyI can't wait for years down the line for my life to be ruined when one of my random hookups, or a girl I've never actually done anything with, calls me out and society just believes her with no evidence. A decade later. This doesn’t actually happen with any troubling regularity and you are perpetuating a damaging narrative. I doubt you care or believe that, though. Duke lacrosse, UVa, mattress girl, brock turner.Literally 3 out of the 4 big stories I can think of all turned out to be hoaxes.OP complained about 'he said, she said'.  You responded by playing 'he said, she said'Pretty weakBrock Turner is a hoax?Do you really think that it's more likely that a rape accusation is false than true? What bubble do you people live in?Nah and your exceptions prove the point. I’m not going to waste my time, though. Once is all it takes for the accused. Just like any other victimization.You need to read more news. It isn't as sensationalized when the story end up being fake, so you hardly hear about those cases. People just remember the accusation.This is why the statute of limitations exists I believe for some crimes. Probably not rape or murder though.Or... a dude. &gt;13 years later&gt;No evidence &gt;Blaine at the peak of his career &gt;said model's career is about to end Who's side are we on again?If you have an allegation that's of something that occurred over 10 years ago, and you didn't want to bring it up at the time, it's really not fair to drag someone's name through the mud and claim they're a rapist 10 years later.  If it's true then it's awful she experienced that, but how the hell are you going to have proof of a rape from 10 years ago?  If you're not going to report it when it happens you should probably just keep your mouth shut and move on with your life.Yah! Same goes with pedophiles right? These kids didn't say anything when it happened, how dare they speak up later in life when they've grown strong enough to confront their abuser... right? you stupid fuckNo, not the same with young children since they're young children you nutjob.  But if you're a grown adult when someone rapes or assaults you and you decide to stay silent that's on you.   You shouldn't publicly accuse someone of rape ten years after the incident and basically slander them and destroy their reputation. If someone actually committed rape they deserve to have their reputation dragged through the mud at a minimum. No matter how much time has passed. In no way does the victims (lack of) response mitigate the perpetrator's moral responsibility for what happened.But what if he didn't? It has been so long at this point that there is absolutely no evidence. &gt; “My client vehemently denies that he raped or sexually assaulted any woman, ever, and **he specifically denies raping a woman in 2004**,”What a weird comment to make.It's not weird to specifically deny the accusation alongside a flat denial.Just thought is was weird to specifically call out 2004. The first part of the sentence pretty much covers every year with the "...any woman, ever" statement.Right, but this is Blaine's lawyer, he has a good reason to specifically refute the accusation.It'd be weird if it was just a casual conversation with no context.DaRealGiovanni - "Stein63, I have never pooped in a sun roof, and I certainly didn't poop in your sunroof when I got back from lunch."If I walked in the door of your office and said that, it'd be weird, but if the scene starts with  Stein63 - "DaRealGiovanni, did you poop in my sunroof when you got back from lunch?"It's not weird anymore.Good point, I just didn't see it.Its lawyer talk. Remember, anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. He made a general denial and a specific denial to cover all the bases.he cut off his dick as part of his magic act in 2004Model of what?David Blaine, what the eff?!?I've noticed a pattern in society.  Women have sex like lunatics contracting std's along the way.   They have sex with people, then regret it.   Then they don't know what to do.   Refund?  Nope bitch, you dumb!  And probably drunk too.They realize most of their net worth is in their sex, so later on in life when they have no power they are sad.   Awwwwe.  You don't get credit for having sex with someone.   Damn the older I get the more sexist I get;  this fucking sucks![removed]Clearly the media is seeking these stories out because of the Weinstein stuff. Sexual assault has been a widespread problem since the dawn of time.In another article it said she admitted having a problem with 'sobriety' during that time and that her then boyfriend told her she was allowing men to 'use her like meat'. That doesn't mean Blaine isn't guilty, but it should raise questions. How does one defend themselves against charges like this? His name is dragged in the dirt and at this resolve it is unlikely her allegation can be proved.This thread is fucking cancerBlaine always seemed like a creepy ass chomo.  Not surprised to hear he's actually a creepShe waited 12 years to go to London to report it?? How can an accusation from over 10 years ago be proven?   Wouldn't it be his word against hers?[removed]That's disgusting. It follows the same reasoning as saying wealthy people deserve to get robbed.Actually no it's not in any way the same.  I never said she deserved to get raped.
Time to hit up /pol/ to see what the autists come up with.Somebody already told me Obama's friends were pulling the strings.Word on /pol/ is that it was the Jews.https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32144493.pdflizard communists* shot JFK from two different planes of existence.This is gonna be good,  I'm sure we'll get tons of poat about people finding "something". Whether it is actually good we'll see. Documents have already been found which confirm a second shooter. JFK was shot in the throat through the front wind shield.Since Trump Supporters can't read and know nothing about their own government I can imagine they'll be pretty disappointed. So far from what I read one file talks about how gullible the populace is to conspiracy theories but of course modern conspiracy theorists will gloss over that and Trumpists shall remain brainwashed.I'm not brainwashed, you are brainwashed.Whoa.  Never thought about it this way before.

Let me list the number of times Brute force has stopped drug movement or use:That's a very thorough list!INB4 they try to tell us cannabis is somehow responsible.That's exactly what Sessions is doing.INB4 some redditor tells us legalizing marijuana will fix all of this.Have you read any of the articles on declining opioids addiction in legal states?I have. My gripe is that the conversation is much more nuanced than "legalize marijuana" and a lot of threads seem to get shut down with that comment.Yeah, right, because the zero tolerance and youth drug education has shown any better results.What you are saying is my point. It's not about marijuana it's about substance education.  "Marijuana Legalization will fix it" is naive and the opposite of education. There needs to be a real discussion about opoids. Perhaps some should be legalized in some capacity? We need to look into other types of therapy, root causes, etc. But it's not like you legalize marijuana and the opoid crisis goes away. And if one were a marijuana advocate, they should be extremely cautious to tie them to opiates in any kind of way.The opiate crisis will decrease. Marijuana isn't a pain medication per say, but it does allow pain patients to take less of their medication. Less narcotics = Lower chance of addiction and less chance of sudden death. No one ever thinks we can prevent all tragedy. But if we can take steps to reduce death and addiction, all options should be on the table. My fear is that all that will be done is more addicts in jail, and legitimate pain patients suffer due to tighter restrictions or fears from doctors getting in trouble. The war on drugs is not, and will never work. I think in some ways the war on drugs created this problem.some opiods are legal, that's what created this clusterf*ck of addiction crisis. you get hurt, you get pain medicine, which is HYPER addictive and strong, your medical condition is 'fixed' your pills are cut off.  you can't get your legal opiods so you go to heroin which is being cut with fentanyl which kills you or you go to a pill mill and get god knows what. No, what I said is that your point has no teeth, because it doesn't work either. You think 1940's era douchnozzle sessions is really going to have a good education system? Surely to include the term "gateway" drugs.And yes, the correlation I was referring to basically said in places with legal weed the options crisis was going away.&gt;And yes, the correlation I was referring to basically said in places with legal weed the options crisis was going away.You may want to read those again. There is no definite correlation, the studies are clear on that. The decrease is also not terribly significant, something like a 6% drop if I remember correctly. And that drop is after a steady increase. There have been ups and downs throughout recent decades even before legalization.One thing I've never heard explained: if marijuana is the answer to opiate addiction then why are addicts who use marijuana on a regular basis still struggling? Marijuana is not behind some legal firewall for heroin addicts, I've never known a single addict who didn't smoke pot.Why would anyone be silly enough to say something like that, backed by facts and history?  Don't we know that only people's opinions matter?  The FACT that legalizing marijuana causes a localized drop in opioid usage means nothing when corkyskog FEELS like that isn't true.or the fact that CBD can be a valid, non-addictive pain treatment... lets listen to big pharma instead when they say oxy isn't addictive Non addictive and even more importantly, non pyschoactive. Yet something that gets you as high as an aspirin is illegal.So a crack down on drug companies? Great!Oh wait, that hurts rich people. Nah he's just gonna chuck more poor brown people in private prisons. Because that totally helps. I'm hoping for the best but the way things are going I feel we are gonna get screwedAll while sending more troops into Afghanistan to protect poppy fields from Taliban. What will the us government do with afghan poppy??? Funny how the war in Afghanistan follows the opiate rise...Wow you're really onto something that people haven't noticed in the last decade /sit's because the US govt won't let them grow wheat... cause then they'd be competing with US farmersWtf i love the opioid crisis now-reddit&gt; A White House statement issued Thursday evening said that Trump “has instructed his Administration to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic.”  August 10th, 2017        11 Weeks later (almost a fiscal quarter) he is going to read the same statement?     Trump is all talk. Wait till those pharma bros line his pocket. Not fair. He isn't all talk.He is also some tweets.Not you specifically, this is more of a general statement. I can't believe how many people want the POTUS to fail, to me you should always want your president to do a good job. I wasn't a fan(didn't have blind hatred)of Obama, but still wanted him to do a good job, even after his 1st term I was hoping he could step it up in his 2nd.&gt;Trump is all talk.I don't know what you're talking, he totally released his taxes, his super secret plan to defeat ISIS, his plant to make Mexico pay for a wall, his healthcare plan that has everyone covered, the information on his 2-3 million illegals, proof that Obama his hiding in his microwave, the "very interesting" details from his secret Hawaii birther investigation, he drained the swamp, he kept his promise to never golf, and he locked up Hillary.all talk...pfft.  that's some Covfefe.  If Trump descended from the clouds with a glowing halo and magic wand which cured every addict in the country you would still be here bitching it wasn't done fast enough.Meanwhile drug deaths FAR outnumber gun deaths (of which are mostly suicide and gang violence) and all Obama wanted to do was cry about muh gun control.  Where was Obama addressing exponentially increasing overdoses in the US?Username definitely checks out.just from like 2 secs of googling:https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/19/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-prescription-opioid-and-heroin&gt;If Trump descended from the clouds with a glowing halo and magic wand which cured every addict in the country you would still be here bitching it wasn't done fast enough.That's nice but it doesn't really change the fact that he said this before, did nothing, and is coming out to say it again. Given his previous inaction, are we to expect something different?Also, if we switch "Trump" with "Obama" then that statement becomes infinitely more applicable to you than it ever would be to us.You're gonna have a bountiful hunt, m8.An awareness week?  Lmfao talk about a virtue signal.  So productive!&gt;Leading up to and during Awareness Week, Federal agencies are taking a number of actions, including: ...Read much? Stop being a political hack.Only 2 laws passed relating to guns under Obama, both of which expanded gun rights. &gt; If Trump descended from the clouds with a glowing halo and magic wand I would grab him in his pussy.            &gt; you would still be here bitching it wasn't done fast enough.    20+% of his term is over.  He hasn't done shit but divide America and make his buddies more powerful. Gun nuts love guns.Trump has done nothing but fail. At least Obama was a real leader. [removed]His stewardship set the economy on an upward tract. He handled the middle east well. Killer Osama. Showed good leadership in general and fought for the people. He wasn't too conservative in some areas. But overall he's easily top ten best presidents. Why do white people prefer popping pills? Based on my ex's mom it's because they can claim an air of legitimacy because they are taking prescription pills. Plus less likely to deal with "scary people" who sell heroinDo you not know many black people? Because they also love popping pills. I'm not sure about Latinos or asians, but I'm sure they love popping pills to.Because we got shit to do..Well shit. Now we KNOW it isn't going to get better anytime soon.  He did that already and proceeded to do nothing. He's probably just trying to cover up Georgia deleting their data. this is the second time isn't it?His plan his to drastically increase arrests so his for profit prison buddies can line their pockets, while doing nothing to the companies that are responsible My ex smashed her finger nail and needed to have it removed. The doctor prescribed her 120 Vicodin!If she doesn't need them, can I have them?Do you have a time machine?Well, yes, I do.  How do you know this?!Trump is like a bad TV show that will not end, and now we have reruns.I love how people convent lyrics forget the recent past.Did he watch 60 minutes?[removed]of course you do.  [removed]bwhaha, you're some kind of special.  meaningless until he pushes measures to do something about it such as investigating drug companies for flooding the market, doctors for overperscribing, legalizaing marijuana (proven over and over to reduce opioid usage), and hosting safe cessation programs like European countries have.If he doesn't do these things, this is lipservice and nothing more, just like all the money he has promised, all the lies about not cutting programs, all the promises he made the working class who have not benefited at all and will not, and most importantly the Magnitsky sanctions.Trump makes promises he will never keep and this is just one of them.You just listed the things in the plan lol.Except you left out going after china for manufacturing fentanyl. Also, he isnt planning on legalizing marijuana but other than that you listed the plan.Doesn't Trump realize that by declaring Opioids a National Emergency, it's basically like going on air and saying, " This shit is so good it could kill you,"? The opioid crisis is so good at stopping it's self that there isn't a real need to follow up on it. I think it's something that's better to just let go, and it will all be resolved eventually. Dying from opioid use is like receiving a Darwin award.
For those that didn't read the article: This is not the brother that was interviewed on TV. This brother was off the radar and living in assisted living, there was an open investigation after a tip and the police were just not aware of his whereabouts. Between the two brothers and the dad that robbed a bank, this family is a few fries short of a happy meal...Tomorrow, we find out if the uncle shot JFK or not.These guys are related to Ted Cruz's dad?It's going to be thousands of pages completely blacked out and right in the middle there will be "Rafael Cruz" surrounding by black followed by "little ... Ted", and a fresh pepe letter head...Next day there'll be a press conference,Trump: "I can't speak on the specific of the JFK thing because people tell me it's still pretty secret, you know how they are, but I will tell you one thing, I would not let Ted Cruz around my kids. NASTY." You put out better satirical comedy than The Onion right now.The onion is doing it's best but the planet simply stepped up the crazy a few levels.I've seen some headlines and clicked before I noticed it was the onion - fully expecting it to be a news source.I think the toy's missing too.Might be in the van. You saw and opportunity and took it.Just like the kid./r/jesuschristreddit Yo yo, I'm here r/beetlejuicing I disagreeThe happy too, the happy is missing.Here I am! Where the fuck were you?Playing with Ronald again. I’m so sorry...This story doesn't really tell us anything about the shooter's motive, but it looks like his family was ~~kind of~~ shitty.(edited, they're very shitty)A "kind of" shitty family gets too drunk and loud at their backyard parties and never tips their waiter. Mass shootings, bank robberies, and child porn is officially shitty.yeah just fucking horrible, really. I mean how does it get worse than this?Imagine being the normal one from that family. A nice, Well adjusted, contributing member of society. And everyone who knows about your family is just waiting for you to snap. Yeah the nice brother who did the interview after the shooting seemed like a really nice dude. I feel like he's not guna have a normal life now.Then again for all we know he might arrange dog fights in his spare time. You just don't know.This comment chain is a demonstration of how his life is ruined.Nah, I assume that about everyone.“Huh. That old lady that was sweet to me and gave me a cookie seemed really nice. Or maybe she was horribly abusive to her family for decades. Either way, yummy macaroon.”Hey man, I get way too drunk in my backyard all the time. I still tip every time unless the service was phenomenally shitty...How the hell did the third brother seem so normal then? He's either done really well for himself  or skins people in his basement for fun. [deleted]In families with a bunch of fuckups inevitably there is one person who refuses to be just another fuckup. Social scientists call this the *Michael Bluth Principle*"... They did not."One of my friends is like this. Drug dealing gangsta wannabe brother knocked up a high schooler (its ok, she's legal and he's youngish), no dad, mom implied to be a stripper, alcoholic uncle, and... law student and amateur baker specializing in French desserts. The drug dealer brother is cool though, he hangs out with us occasionally for some reason&gt; amateur baker specializing in French desserts. The drug dealer brother is cool though, he hangs out with us occasionally for some reasonHmmm.. wonder whyGonna guess it's because despite being a drug dealer, that's still his brother?Yeah, my dad was that brother in his family. Every other one of his siblings has struggled with substance abuse and other issues, meanwhile my dad is a clean-cut guy with a good job who's been married to my mom for 30 years.You sure he doesn't skin people in his basement? You should check. To be sure.Don't do it, I've seen the movies, that doesn't end well. Ignorance is bliss here, really.Very few families are through and through shitty. Generally it’s one poor normal soul stuck with assholes "Life is unfair..."I betcha the FBI is going to be closely monitoring his brother for a very long time.Hopefully not, because you are not responsible for the actions of your family.Not in North Korea! 3 generations DEADHow does one live in assisted living *and* off the radar? Assisted living sounds pretty on the radar to me./to clarify, people, that's a joke. You know, like, how could he be "off the radar" if someone has their hand up his ass crack every day to clean it. Clearly that hand has seen some shit. See something, say something, people. Depends on the pay source.  If, he was private pay, he is way off radar.  HIPPA and everything...Not nearly as much reporting as nursing homes.  I've worked both.Okay that's kind of a relief that guy seemed genuine and normal. I feel for him, its not his fault his fam ended up like that.Man, can you imagine being that guy right now? What a weird turn his life/family took this year. I mean as far as we know he hasn't done anything wrong, but his entire world has been turned upside down twice and he has to live his life now knowing the kind of heinous creatures his direct blood relatives, whom he grew up with and loved, are.Fuck his relatives, can you imagine how this innocent guys neighbors and community is going to look at him thanks to his family? I'd say that hopefully they'd understand even if his relatives did really fucked up shit he isn't to be blamed... but he lives in Florida, so....Doesn't matter where he lives. People are shit heads. Especially when you get fear involved.I'd probably look into moving and getting my last name changed at this point. I kinda freaked out for a second because that guy lives in my neighborhood. He is just a totally normal and friendly guy.Should reach out to him if you see him at the store or something. Things are probably pretty bad right now for him.  Even a friendly conversation that’s normal would be nice.From what I can tell, everyone in the neighborhood has seemed pretty supportive of him and the family, which is good to see.He seems like the kind of guy who would stick around at the end of a barbecue to help clean up so he could tell you all about this really interesting article he read in Popular Mechanics. So mass murder, sex crimes, bank robbery, what's next for the paddocks? The brother that was on TV is from Florida so I will patiently wait for news on the fall of his meth/exotic animal empire. Ironically, the one from Florida is normal.Florida man doesn't go on killing spree or collect CP. More on this shocking story at 11That's called Florida weird.The one normal brother dating:“Baby, just gonna let you know, my family is awful”“Come on honey let me meet them, they can’t be that bad”“No babe, *you have no idea*”If I were him, I'd change my name. Seriously, this *will* follow him if he doesn't, and probably still will if he doesI have a family with similar levels of fucked upness, and I just tell people we don't associate. If they press, I go on to say that the ones who aren't dead or in jail are just the smart ones, because that's where they all belong. The nicer ones usually end up in assisted living for the mentally ill. I'm honestly afraid sometimes I'm just gonna wake up and be an evil cunt because that's my family.So yeah, just tell people your family is literally evil and that's why you moved 1500 miles away.I moved to the other side of the country, severed all ties and pretend I don’t have a family, It’s amazing how great my life has been since I excised that cancerous tumour from my life.You think your family is crazy?Hmm, yes.But not Paddock family crazy! Yeah, my family is get in fist fights and scream at each other crazy, not mass murderer and pedo crazy. Our families should drink together.I’m thinking they probably shouldn’t.Yep, just lazier. The Paddock family Christmas dinner this year is going to be a treat.

Eat up.' I live in North Hollywood, been hearing helicopters all morning.I feel for the third brother, having two shit people in your family like that means everyone will be expecting something bad from you.Three shit people in the family. Dad was on the FBI Most Wanted list.Well, at least anything that the third brother does now will only seem like an achievement.Robs a liquor store, hey at least you aren't like your brothers!Crashes a car, hey at least I didn't rob a bank and get on the FBI most wanted!Gets caught with meth, hey at least I didn't have a stash of kiddy porn!The dude can't fail at this point, the bar is slow low for him.I mean, he can reverse the measure and try to go for broke.They said in a previous article that the brothers were estranged. I feel sorry for Eric just the same.I would hate to have a family member murdered.  I would also hate to have a family member murder someone else.  I am not sure which is worse.  I would hate wondering if I missed something or could have stopped them in some way.  &gt; I would hate to have a family member murdered. I would also hate to have a family member murder someone else. I am not sure which is worse. Do you want to feel angry and sad or deeply ashamed? Woof, I am not sure. This is a tough one for me to choose between. If we are talking close family members, like siblings and parents then I think my answer would have to be having a family member murdered. I could never in a million bajillion years see any of the family members I am close with murder someone and if they did I would be absolutely floored. I consider myself lucky that my dad killed himself instead of killing my mom and/or killing me (which we know he considered) and instead just arranged things so that I would be the one to find him.  That really fucked up a lot of shit for me.  I can't say I've ever felt grief or shame -- it's something else, a range of feelings that I never successfully found words for. Agreed.  Not only would that mean someone I don't know died, which would be a faceless, abstract tragedy, but also *the person I thought I knew* would cease to exist.  It's obvious they're not murderers to me now, they're people I trust and love.  If that turns out to be a lie, and then it's like I've lost them just the same.  That would be tragic.Okay, so it wasn't the guy on TV. HEAR THAT REDDIT? NOT THE GUY ON TV.so, guy on tv. got it. Let's ruin his life! *boston marathon intensifies*I always thought he looked a little rapey during those interviews Literally half the thread are people thinking it's the TV brother.

I would say the former[deleted]At least you aren't in denial. I just can't comprehend how some people would still defend their family if they've done something horrible. Had a talk with some guy once. He'd help hide the body and provide an alibi should one of his family members torture, rape and viciously murder someone. I'm not sorry to say that if I discovered that about anyone I know, friend or family, that I would immediately go to the police. It's even worse when it's murder in the family. Why would you defend your father for example for murdering your mother?? Maybe if it was assisted suicide because euthanasia wasn't granted, but cold blooded murder for money or whatever other reason?Being their momDefnitely the mass murderChild porn is insanely bad but mass murder is worseIt's pretty amazing that he's a meth addicted paedophile and somehow he's NOT their mothers biggest disappointment It's even worse than that because people remember his face from all the tv interviews and now a lot of people will mistakenly think he was the child porn brother."Perfectly Normal famil..."*Hears news of child porn arrest*"Fuck it I am changing my name"The shit apple doesn't fall far from the shit tree.Gotta pour another one out for my homie...[removed][removed][removed][removed]Bruce is not the same brother who has made TV rounds, that man was Eric Paddock.Damn I feel sorry for that guy He's understandably frazzled and confused in all his interviews, now he may have to go for round 2 with the media. &gt;*edit thanks for my first reddit gold kind stranger!I hate to break it to you, bud, but you don't have gold, lol.Yikes, eric paddock has some shitty brothers.Just wait until tomorrow's report:Eric Paddock likes Pineapple on his Pizza and hates Rick and Morty.Woah dude keep it down, you sure you wanna rattle THAT cage?

This guy's mom must be so sad about how her kids turned outShe married a bank robber. Couldn't have been too far out of thought that her kids would be ... complicated.I haven't looked into it. I wonder if he was a bank robber before they married. They definitely seem to have caused a lot of harm to a lot of people. Cue conspiracy theories about a cover up People all acting like Stephen Paddock is so normal, with a normal family, no way he could have been the shooter. Makes no sense!Son of a bank robber, brother to a pedo. Very normal family so far.its almost like people make their own choicesIf you ever feel like you're a bad parent just remember you didnt raise a mass murderer and a pedophileIt can be genetic too. Mental health isn't a clear cut case. Maybe it was sexual trauma by other people. Maybe it was social trauma by being bullied by peers. Maybe it was genetic.The hardest thing to accept is maybe there's no good reason they're the way they are. ITT: Different BrotherI know this isn't the brother who was interviewed, but between child pornography, mass shooting, and bank robbing, I think this family is not being forthright when they say they have no idea where the Vegas shooter's motivation comes from.  You have *that much* shit going, you know damn well which family members are fucked in the head.Not necessarily.If the entire family is fucked up, totally plausible the members don't recognize the batshit in themselves. You can't really judge the TV brother based on mass media interviews, either, so we don't really know whether or not he is also nuts. Also if a family is majority nuts but there are one or two normal people in it, it's extremely common for the normal people to 'bracket off' the insanity as a coping mechanism. They basically ignore their family members' bad behaviors and deny that they are irregular in order to avoid facing the fact that they've had a fucked up life, which would dredge up a ton of trauma that'd need to be dealt with. In some families I know there's one kid who realized everything is messed up and keeps his distance. That kid lives in Florida. And becomes Florida ManIf you're sane and want to keep away from the batshit bullshit, you cut your ties. cut your losses, and keep physical distance between yourself and the batshit. Boundaries are lonely sometimes, but I'd rather be sane, stress free, and lonely than dealing with people's basket case crisis of the week bullshit all the time. I mean, if that much crazy goes on in your family, you might be inclined to stay far away from them.The worst mass shooting in American history and it's already out of the news cycle after less than a month. Columbine was still a topic of discussion 7-8 months after it happened. Crazy how desensitized we are getting to mass shootings, we're not even demanding any legislative action anymore Columbine had a lot more for the meida to go after.   The shooters left copious ammounts of propaganda behind, had online presences that were 'scary'.  Consumed violent media like doom and video games so that could spin off a bunch of "is you child training to KILL?  News at 11!"  CNN was still the only real 24 hour news channel at the time.  Colombine also spun all these zero tolerance policy for kids in manson t shirts and black nail polish.    It was a gold mine for the media since they had so much to spin.   Vegas left a bunch of bodies, no motive, and really not much else.   Hard to paint a villian when the shooter looks and acts like every dopey white dude that buys gold from the day time TV advertisers.   If he had left a note with a bunch of his bull shit views and wore a NIN t shirt then we would still be hearing about it. Spot fucking on dude Honestly, don't we also complain if the shooter is getting copious amounts of airtime? Which do we want - constant coverage that elevates a person and their name into infamy and appeals to other sick individuals or "not enough" coverage that seems to downplay the actions? maybe. Could also be because of how we have become more instantly  connected to news that stories come and go quicker. Columbine happened before most phones even had color screens and most Americans had 56k internet. News travels much faster and becomes old much quicker now days. The FBI also released their analysis of the sandy hook shooter and mentioned that he too had some affinity to pedophilua.
Considering how bad these things can be, like what happened in Tianjin, glad to see nothing substantially worse occurred.I’m really sad this isn’t a bigger story. West Virginia is always being taken advantage of by companies and this needs to be fought. It’s still burning!   This is the future under Republicans.    People should be concerned , very concerned if they care about their own livlihood and quality of life.Him Justice was a Democrat at the time he was elected...he’s just a party changing asshat.Exactly. Needs to be said more often.Then you also believe that Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, and every other city war zone are the future under democrats. Well said.What Republican was at fault for the warehouse fire in Oakland?
The question I have is who did he piss off to set off this shit storm. It's pretty much been an open secret in Hollywood for years but no one said anythingYup. Like Bryan Singer fucking underage boys is also an open secretseriously? Im new to the party here, who hasnt been accused yet?He stopped being the behemoth of industry he used to be. The 1990s and early to mid 2000s he was far more powerful a producer. Today a different crop rule at the top of Hollywood and he simply lost the power to make and break careers, and without that people stopped fearing him.He bullied and raped whoever he wanted, all of Hollywood hated him. His influence was like a  foot crushing down on everybody's face... and when you let up pressure like that for even a second, they go for the jugular.He was a hated piece of sh*t and unlike previously where he could use his powers to silence the media, his reach doesn't affect social media.Once online mob wanted his head, everyone jumped ship to avoid the backlash and left him.Droopy-Eye Weinstein is still here in Arizona, inviting fellow patients to watch him shower.I wonder if he will bring down others if he goes. I imagine a 300 million $ retirement(150 post divorce) and this guy living on a beach harassing women who are not famous or trying to be.
But nothing for the 111 liberal groups targeted?https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/liberal-groups-got-irs-scrutiny-too-inspector-general-finds/2017/10/04/e9b6e3c4-a929-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?utm_term=.f67475cc1728Source for those interested.Shh, you're ruining /u/Hunting4Downvotes agenda. [deleted]They didnt though. They were delayed and targeted because those groups were found to be committing tax fraud at a significantly higher rate. That is all. Just criminals crying that they were targeted to avoid admitting they broke tax laws.&gt; Criminals...Do you have any evidence that the groups who were part of the class action violated tax laws? Yes, the IG report. So nobody will be going to jail?  And liberals still want to pretend Obama's admin was "scandal free" ?  If Trump's admin did this, how many would be crying for impeachment for a gross abuse of power?I long to live in a country where right/wrong can be determined without “but your side”.If it’s wrong, it’s wrong.It was scandal free. The irs provided evidence and clearly showed that the groups were targeted. However they were not targeted for their political beliefs, it was because those groups were commiting tax fraud at a significantly higher rate than other groups, and were put on hold due to said fraud.that is why the groups were getting beaten in court so badly. Thats why the republicans are settling instead of letting this go to court, because they know the irs would win. This is nothing more than republicans funneling government taxes into their personal accounts.So the the IRS admitted to improper behavior, like screening based on religious affiliation and whether or not groups had the word "patriot" or "tea party" in their name.  Not legal, end of story.  Hence the settlement.  Not sure why you have to spin a narrative on this one.Yeah there wasn't a big scandal around the Snowden Documents right? Obama wasn't expanding the drone program and simultaneously bombing 7 different countries after promising to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan right? Man, you just cant help moving those goalposts can you? We were talking about the irs thing.He said there were **no** scandals. I merely pointed out that this was falseI said there were no scandal in the context of talking about the irs. I want to make sure to clarify that so there can be no question or confusion.The IRS admitted it was wrong when it based screenings of the groups' applications on their names or **policy positions**, subjected the groups to heightened scrutiny, and delays and demanded unnecessary information from the groups, the agreement in the Washington case said. -ReutersYou mean the republicans that took office after the event and literally changed the whole position of the IRS? Sorry, if your proof of wrongdoing is that the people being investigated for fraud told you the investigation was nothing, then you have no proof.So why did the IRS formally apologize for targeting them today? If they were being targeted because they legitimately committed tax fraud more often than other groups then the IRS was just doing its job. The IRS admitted it did this based on their policy positions.&gt; So why did the IRS formally apologize for targeting them today?Because they are controlled by republicans now, and the republicans are the ones who own the organizations being investigated. They literally took over and then told everyone that they were totally not doing anything wrong. &gt; If they were being targeted because they legitimately committed tax fraud more often than other groups then the IRS was just doing its job.Yes, it was. &gt; The IRS admitted it did this based on their policy positions.Yes, and that is a very carefully crafted contextual lie. It did not harm them in any way due to their **policy positions**. It looked for **key words** associated with groups likely to commit fraud, and inspected the likely fraudulent organizations more closely, then delayed the ones that were committing fraud, and **passed the ones who were legal** just like any other political group. This was never about policy, it was because republican groups with specific names were common fronts for tax fraud. They did the exact same thing to democratic groups and nonpolitical groups. They investigated likely fraudulent organizations. Nothing more. The IG report clearly provided proof of this. The only reason this changed, is because republicans are now in control of the IRS, and are using that control to declare their own organizations innocent, and using that lie to attack democrats. And they will intentionally snip pieces of the report intentionally out of context to change their meaning, and thereby convince people who didn't bother reading the report that it says the opposite of what it did. I've criticized Obama for his increase in drone strikes, but to be fair, many would prefer to use drones than to have boots on the ground getting killed. Drone tech is better than ever &amp; he happened to be president when the tech opportunity kicked in. Drones surely have their problems, but it seems better than deploying more troops or pulling out entirely.Predator drones came about in the mid 90's.... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-1_PredatorSure, and the first mobile phone came out in the 1970s. Tech takes time to mature.Yeah but are people using 1970's phones today? Read the Wikipedia page. Those drones invented in 1995 are the ones being used, not some newer model.Fair point. Have there not been any updates since the original? 90's tech seems ancient by comparison, but I always assumed the military was a few decades more advanced than what the public has access to. (except for nuclear management, much of which *is* practically ancient)A lot of the reason for nuclear tech being kept low tech is to make it unhackable. Germany had some Patriot missile launchers get hacked in Turkey a while back. A nuke doesn't need a precision guidance system.Bush had access to drones, hell Clinton did too. Chose not to use them nearly as extensively. Attacked significantly fewer sovereign nations (not that I approve of those wars either).Arguably, the tech has gotten better from the Clinton and Bush era.  So likely to be useful in situations now that weren’t viable back then.Matter of factly it's the same model of drone we are talking about. Is it that hard to believe that different Presidents simply employed different tactics?Sure, the president’s could have used different tactics, but are they dictated due to technology or not?  I’m arguing that early on, the technology and availability definitely would have had an impact.  If you only have a few armed drones with long lagtimes in the beginning, it’s less dependable compared to hundreds of drones now with better sensors and no lagtime.Even if Obama wasn't using the same models which came about during the Clinton presidency, and even if they were a more advanced model, they don't do anything a plane with a pilot couldn't and he was still dropping bombs on more than triple the number of countries Bush was. 26,000 bombs in 2016 alone.They do one thing a plane with a pilot doesn't do.  They don't kill or get the pilot captured when they crash/get shot down.  So less negative outcry/publicity and more incentive to use them vs piloted planes if they give the same (or close to it) results.   In the beginning, with few drones that weren't as dependable, there was more incentive to use the pilots (even with that risk).  In the current day with lots of drones that are fairly dependable, there's less incentive to use pilots.  With lots of drones available, there's also more incentive to use those drones (hey we spent all this money on them, and it's not like we have pilots at risk, etc).Killing terrorists is a good thing Bombing sovereign nations we aren't at war with isnt.[deleted]Congratulations, you were able to name one of the 7[deleted]Did I say their hands were clean. Just because Trump is scum doesn't mean Obama was Jesus Christ. The claim was that there were no scandals while Obama was President If they harbor terrorists,  it's perfectly fine.  Get over itAnd if another country were to label American citizens terrorists and kill them within our borders?We'd wreck them because it's false? Wtf kind of stupid question is that.What crime was committed. You're talking about jailing Americans. So if you actually love your country, be specificI mean, if Trump's administration did what's claimed, we'd barely have time to react to it before he called the queen of Jordan the n-word or something and everyone had to move on to the next one. 
To anyone unaware, this man has Vascular Parkinsons, the origin of symptoms arising from constant tiny strokes in the brain.This guy hasn't been all there for awhile. I think this should be near the top of the list. Stroke victims tend to have DRAMATIC shifts in their personality. If GHWB was doing this in the 80s... different storyRape allegations against public figures aren’t news unless there’s at least evidence.so all the allegations against weinstein arnt news There is evidence against Weinstein though. there's a tape recording that came out after the new york times article, but that's about it Ugh, as if being all grabby hands wasn't bad enough, he's ALSO throwing dad jokes while he gropes.Great grandpa jokes, they're like dad jokes but with a pat on the ass included.Here’s his “joke” that the other story with the first woman didn’t mention.&gt; Grolnick said: “He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, ‘Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?’ As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, ‘David Cop-a-Feel!’” Did he really say that?  Hahahaha. Epic if he did..I might use that.Yeah its clear he's a dirty old man.  It's sad that people are trying to excuse him because he's in a wheelchair.My grandma had Alzheimers. She would regularly put on the Playboy and Hustler channel on full blast when we'd visit. She also tried to swat my cousin away so she could hit on her husband (which we all thought was cute). She was a devout and highly conservative Catholic all her life. She was married to my grandfather for over 60 years. The brain degenerating can cause real differences in people's behaviours.  Mostly because he is senile and he isn’t the only old man, president or not, to do this. Work at a nursing home for a while and see what I mean. I complained a few times, but the bosses shrugged it off and said deal with it. Old asshole lady had a crush on my male coworker and always tried to kiss him. She got a scolding and nothing else. I think more people are excusing him because these incidents happen after he turned 90 years old, and he probably is no longer in command of his faculties and impulse control. And whether or not you agreed with him politically, GHWB was a decent president and a great and honorable man and it’s unfortunate that this will be a part of his legacy. At this point it's becoming part of every living elderly celebrity's legacy. It’s sad. People that worked hard and served their countries or their industries well for years have their memories trashed because they really aren’t what they once were and when you get old you just don’t function as well and aren’t able to control their behaviors like they once were (and we all have bad thoughts and impulses from time to time). To be clear, this is very different than people like Weinstein and others that engaged in this behavior for their careers well before they became old. No it's society that's changed, or at least the very vocal ones... as well as news reporters being tabloid journalists about disgracing celebrities with something that was part of the times. You think Elvis wasn't a flirt? The Rat Pack? I know everyone of them had their moments. And many of them. But now everyone is told that they're going to get vindicated in court for a pinch from 35 years ago.. and a buttload of money, and to "shine a light on all butt pinchers" as long as they tell their story. Somebody get Michael Caine to higher ground.The only thing going to save them is lowering into the ground. &gt; *... and he probably is no longer in command of his faculties and impulse control.*Or maybe... just maybe, he has the old man's advantage of no longer seeing a reason to give a fuck what you think, what I think, what Barbara thinks, what anyone thinks.Then they need to keep him the hell away from people Great and honorable... Why? Real question, why do you think that? Not saying he wasn't. Or was. Just looking for your view.His actions weren't decent or honorable. His lies about tax policy, a wholly unnecessary and bloodthirsty invasion of panama and his defense of slaveholding oil barons in Kuwait show us a true piece a shit who should be remembered as a greedy and traitorous scumfuck. TIL people were actually against the first Iraq War.Cuba voted against UN resolution to establish UNIKOM, and sanctions.None of these incident happened after he waa 90 He’s 93. One incident above happened in 2014. The other happened in 2016. How old would he have been in both instances?Holy shit, is it the season to grab your 15 minutes of fame by accusing someone of sexual harassment/assault? These posts have been popping up like mushrooms. HGWB is 90 years old and loopy as hell, find a better target to get your self esteem boost from.whoa oh.... george senior likes the señoritas.who doesn't like las bellas señoritas?God that must have been traumatizing .I can't imagine the mental anguish she has gone through and hope she gets the help she needs to pick up the pieces and get on with her life. /sSorry, but why should someone have to put up with this if its unwanted?Yeah, he didn't brutally rape her, so it's totally fine. its just not that big of a deal. It seems more like lets jump on the bandwagon and get 15 seconds of fame to show that you are taking a stand against sexual assault, rather than this man damaged my psyche by touching my butt.I'm a guy and I've had my ass squeezed/slapped many times in bars and at concerts (it's  a nice ass) by both men and women. While these events were annoying, I do not have PTSD nor do I feel the desire to ruin the perpetrators reputation. I have thrown some bows at dudes though.I have to say, it seems women are very hypocritical about this, I get unwanted touching/commenting by drunk women regularly when I go out, and sometimes by sober women during the day, even once in line at the post office. It's as if they don't even register it, like it just doesn't "count" for them. It's pure entitlement. Obviously he was wrong to do this, but I can't help but note the different standard. I don't complain, I just brush it off and move past it seconds later, let alone let it bother me years later.Bush was *shot down* in WW2. His generation was drafted to war and saw 18 year old boys sent off to die, something women were obviously exempt from. I don't really care to hear about his "male privilege" or entitlement.women arnt some monolith, because some women gropped you doesnt make themhypocriticalUnwanted touch on shoulder != groping your ass Okay, so what if an old lady touched his penis? What about unwanted touching in general? It happens to guys too from both men and women. It's not as rampant, but it's an issue and you can't fairly minimize the damage it can do to a guy's psyche. That's hypocritical.Right, but in the same vein i highly doubt these victims of sexual abuse are okay with men getting groped. Him calling women hypocritical for the actions of a different person makes no sense.You seem OK with it"I don't complain, I just brush it off and move past it seconds later, let alone let it bother me years later." makes it sound as if he's making false comparisons. I'm not OK with any unwanted touching but not all unwanted touching is of the same caliber.No your right. My comment was unfounded and unnecessary.No one should be put into a situation like that, it just seems like your saying "yeah but it's worse when it happens to x, your experiences don't matter as much" and as a victim of sexual assault, I just found that a bit triggering. I hope they do. whose being hypocritical I would be like, "wtf? you fucking old hag, get away", and not think about it again.I'm a dude and I've had my ass grabbed many times by both men and women. I don't do it to other people because it is very annoying and an invasion of personal space. It also isn't a big enough deal though that I would claim psychological trauma or try to ruin someone's reputation over it.I also will note that I've called out guys for doing it and even gotten physical over it but I can't do that with women (not that I've ever felt the strong desire too)  because it's not considered a big deal when they sexually harass men. Just to be clear though. Guys who do this are fucking creeps, hence why I've gotten aggressive with them. I would give a 90 year old man in a wheel chair the benefit of the doubt though. [deleted]Ok so then because you "don't let it affect you", no women who get groped should care. Got it.These woman are just looking for their 15 minutes of fame. Useless, money grubbing twats. What are you doing outside of r/incels?He has Vascular Parkinsons, gets many tiny strokes in the brain. I’ve known people with “easier” versions of Parkinson’s and Dementia. Grandma and great aunt and uncle and more. Their personalities change so much, it’s sad and scary. Swearing, violence, and so much more (including being over sexual and sneakily looking at porn or flirting with caregivers). They aren’t the same person anymore, and it’s hard to  accept. They do things that their former self would never do. I wonder if I’ll kill myself or climate change will kill me before it has a chance to get me. I think Bush is truly being affected and it’s making him this way. I bet he’s almost a completely different person now. It’s sad to watch someone spiral, even though I never knew him or voted for him or anything. Only recently followed his case. Don’t think there’s much of him left.  These women are pathetic with this "so and so groped me years ago". They're just trying to get their names in headlines because it's trendy to be a victim these days. It's disgusting. He's admitted he's done it...That sweet victim cred that everyone busts their ass to get.And the potential settlement money.Nobody goes straight to the press so they can get settlement money, that doesn't make any sense.edit: People settle these things to make the story go away. If you start by making the story public, you've burned what leverage you had. Explain to me what I'm missing.Yeah, just like with Bill O'Reilly... oh wait..Yeah it's so weird how this has become the trendy thing to do. Really makes you wonder who is telling the truth. Of course in every single case it's impossible to verify any of this stuff. It may have happened or it may not have. Well you have what amounts to a confession from H.W.'s office, but don't let that influence you.so you prefer sexual assault victims stay silent Read it again in a cynical rather than earnest tone of voice.Did you even read the article? His spokesperson acknowledged this happening more than once. You know what's really fucking pathetic? Victim shaming. Face it, everyone is a victim of *something* in their lifetime. People just want to feel special about it. The same thing happened with that #metoo movement on Facebook that lasted for like a week. I understand that sexual assault is a very serious subject, but the attention seeking is getting out of hand. What those people are saying is "Don't forget about *me* and how important *I* am!". But how many of those people do you think actually get off their asses and volunteer their time or donate their money to the cause? I'll give you a hint: not *nearly* as many who are bitching about it.Perhaps that movement is more showing how widespread of a problem it is and it's a form of solidarity? Many victims are afraid to speak up and seeing solidarity might help them report the problem.This person gets it. You can shame a victim without shaming their victimhood, you know.OMG..... I just remembered!  I must have suppressed it due to the traumatic nature of it all; brace yourself, this might shock the senses; TRIGGER ALERT!Once, when I was 16, my grandma introduced me to her cribbage club.  I was paraded around the room like a piece of meat, pinched and fondled in some rather uncomfortable ways, and all of these ladies had no shame in commenting on my body.... hell, Ethel even pinched my face *immediately* after pinching my 16 year old ass!  Woman had to be at least 50 years older then me!  I was too horrified at the time to say anything but.... #MeTooDon't go victim shaming me and marginalizing my experience you salty lot, being fondled by a dozen old women as a 16 year old is horrifying! Now.... was my experience sexual assault?  By legal definition, YES.  But am I an unreasonable jackass who cannot possibly keep things in a reasonable perspective and realize it was a bunch of senile old women being senile old women to the point of calling it "Sexual Assault"?  FUCK NO!  I sued those old ladies for every nickel they saved; assault is assault and they are every bit as guilty as the serial rapists in prison and it's about god damn time they were held accountable!  /sEdit for clarity; me claiming that getting pinched by a bunch of old ladies as a form of sexual assault is (or should be) insulting to *real* victims of SA like this person; &gt; Years ago, someone attacked me while I was running. A guy, hiding in the bushes. I was running along a major, well-populated, BUSY road in the afternoon when it happened. I was 21 at the time. Thankfully, I was able to get away from the guy before anything more happened than groping (partly because I had mace in my hand and when he saw it, he hesitated and I was able to get away). ^  THAT person was/is a victim of sexual assault, NOT these people who were affected by GHWB.  Those people are just victims of a pretty awful dad-joke.  Move along folks, nothing to see here...Or, you know, don't downplay sexual assault. Just a thought!Don't describe something so tame as "sexual assault". It insults victims of *actual* sexual assaults and diminshes what they went through. The man just won't stop digging!its always funny to me that people come out years later saying "some one groped me"....why not when it happend? or did it?Probably because of the stigma of it, and the fact that asshats won't believe them regardless of when they come forward.It's really not that complicated to see why someone wouldn't come forward especially when the accused is an ex president. I mean you'd have to be REALLY stupid to not understand that.Sometimes I feel it could just be a mistakenly misplaced hand (too low on a waste) for a photo then years later the accuser saying "I was groped!"...why come out now? who really cares.We care about people in power taking advantage and assaulting other people. What the fuck is wrong with you?Reddit can be disgustingly misogynistic. Ignorance abounds. Most of the comments in here are seriously disconcerting. This actually happened, Bush's people admitted so, but there's still all sorts of people saying 'Stop whining, it's not that bad!'  Fuck... pisses me off to no extent.Compassionate people care. More specifically, those with empathy care. Would you feel the same way if it was a loved one of yours that was assaulted and afraid to come forward?It's clearly not a mistake when he's cracking jokes about it while he does it.Shame, fear, it's not going to do anything and lots of other reasons. This is why. Years ago, someone attacked me while I  was running. A guy, hiding in the bushes. I was running along a major, well-populated, BUSY road in the afternoon when it happened. I was 21 at the time. Thankfully, I was able to get away from the guy before anything more happened than groping (partly because I had mace in my hand and when he saw it, he hesitated and I was able to get away). Anyways, I ran home as fast as I’ve ever fucking I run and immediately called the police. An officer was dispatched out. He came to my apartment and here were the first few questions/things he said to me after I gave him a brief description of what happened:-	what were you wearing when this happened? (I was  still wearing jogging shorts and a drenched-in-sweat T-shirt, having obviously just been running)-	did you say anything to him that he could have construed as an invite? -	Hey, you’re a cute girl. These things are going to happen. -	Well, worse could have happened. He didn’t RAPE you or anything. After it was clear he didn’t care I had just been assaulted and other women could be at risk, I told him to leave. And that’s when he proceeded to try and awkwardly ask me out. For a long time, I just couldn’t even process what had happened. That’s how confusing and fucked up it was. So yeah, that’s why women don’t speak out immediately. I was so humiliated by that whole experience that it was years before I told anyone about it outside of my immediate family. Yes. I TOTALLY agree with you. My point was sometimes when people are in the spotlight others will blow some things out of proportions to push an agenda, discredit someone, etc....thats that point I was trying to make...some people are sooooo sensative that a man cant even say "you look great today, did you change your hair style" as a simple non threating observation yet would be called sexist for doing so....I really dont know what Bush did or what the accusations but it seems like one party attacks the other to discredit them any which way they can.Please understand that even a seemingly innocent comment like you describe is, far too often (not always, but often), followed by unwanted advances. So what happens is then someone does make a completely innocent comment that has no intent behind it, and a woman thinks “Fuck, here we go again.” And maybe the guy making the comment today really has no ulterior motive behind it. Maybe it really is just a compliment. But my mind goes into protective mode and thinks about all the time when someone made a comment like that and then did things to me that were unwanted, overly aggressive, or highly inappropriate (like the guy at work who kept complimenting me and then one time rubbed up against me with his fully erect penis because he thought I would like it. Yes. That happened.). I seriously don’t think men fully understand the sheer volume of this shit that women go through, often from the time we’re young and don’t even have the language to explain or process what has happened. And how often it’s been dismissed or downplayed or even turned around to make the woman the guilty party (what was she wearing, did she ask for it, etc, etc, etc). I certainly have no idea what happened in this particular story. But I do know that it’s sometimes very hard to speak up immediately when it does happen, because too often the initial thought is “No one will believe me.” Don’t take this as being insensitive. I am all for respecting woman, however, the point was this:  “At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.” As the article says, he really can’t move his arms well and, my guess, probably had touched peoples behind on accident then joked about it in embarrassment because his arms probably can’t get above waste level....he is an OLD man that did something stupid...ASSAULT: a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on a person (as by lifting a fist in a threatening manner) that puts the person in immediate danger of or in apprehension...he did nor rape her. He did not hold her against his will; he is in a wheel chair and can’t move his arms well…if he did then sure, make huge headlines! He apologized for his inappropriate behavior. This is far from “physical harm or rape” what would warrant world headlines….sorry to trigger anyone. I just think people are making mountains out of mole hills.That's scary and terrible. I'm sorry to hear that you went through that and that the officer who responded was not any help to you or the community. Thank you for sharing.Bush: "...David Cop-a-feel"Grolnick: "Mr President that was inappropriate"END OF FUCKING STORY...but no, she didn't say fuckall then because it wasn't Fidget Spinner trendy yet, but now she's waving her #MeToo flag along with women who are violently abused by their spouse, their boss, complete strangers, etc.My wife kissed me on the head before leaving for work today...I didn't ask for it...unless you are one of those people who think a wedding ring gives her the right to rape me?#MeToo  (not to be confused with #MewTwo, who will violate you and enjoy doing it)93 years old. I declare it okay, for every 93 year old man or woman to grope who they please. It's not like you can't run away faster than him or her.He's not a dirty old man.  He's just a sexy senior citizen. 
People still use McAfee? Ever since Microsoft started giving away their own antivirus for free (Windows Defender/Windows Security Essentials), I stopped using anything else.I've been using AVG free for years successfully. Coupled with strict malware policies, I have yet to encounter any serious issues.Ditto.  I've been amazed at how good free AVG is compared to programs I paid for in the past.Mcafee have some pretty decent enterprise offerings.DoD spends millions on it, and now they're looking for an alternative.K. Shame McAfee is still literally just malware.All those softwares are useless. Stick with the one that comes with windows. I'd argue you should have Malwarebytes installed but as a general antivirus Windows defender should be more than sufficientThe full Enterprise suite is a different monster compared to what a home user uses.Host Intrusion Prevention, Data Loss Prevention, A/V, etc. Thousands of configuration options.There's a lot of people out there who's entire job is managing McAfee.How many times does this enterprise suite get hit with hackers? Is there data? Attempts or successful attack?Large enterprises like those the  U.S. government runs have millions of users, systems, servers, etc.I couldn't even guess how many attempts per day they get, but successful hacks are more often than anyone knows.I've still seen companies that still have windows mobile on their pda.Who - the fuck - uses Windows?  Most people?The vast majority of the general publicWith over 90% market share, I am going to guess quite a few people use it. Given that it is shipped on the majority of the junk that is sold, it’s not surprising.   Slowest in the Cloud.Good on ya, mate. I think I'll buy a McAfee subscription soon.If you need a third party program to stop your computer from doing things you don't want it to do, you're solving the wrong problem.Browser vulnerabilities exist. Sometimes respectable websites have their ads hijacked. Sometimes legitimate downloads can be compromised.Having AV, scanners, ad blockers, and no script extensions aren't solving the wrong problem, its providing security. It's taking responsibility for your own protection.
I don't think "his hands are naturally at that height" works well as a defense when he also makes the "Cop-a-feel" joke.And squeezes the buns."Listen, if the President can't get a pass with grabbing an attractive butt here and there, I don't want to be President"Bill Clinton sounded *awful* in that video... what happened to his voice?8 years of the presidency and serious heart issues will do that to you. Say what you will about W. But that guy maintained a pretty good fitness routine in office.So has Carter post office as well.Carter looks especially amazing due to all of his struggles with cancer. I know Bill Clinton looks frail, but it's because he had to go vegan due to a heart condition and being skinny at an old age does not look flattering.It's also not exactly easy to put on weight once you're that old. Delivery or DiGiorno.jimmy has been very active post-Presidency.he's always attending events and working. looks good for his age.Bush 1 being a contemporary of Jimmy looks ill and frail by comparison.True, but HW also has vascular parkinsonism, and has recently broken a vertebrae and had pneumonia. It's a miracle he's still alive at 93. Have you seen him lately? That vegan diet may add years to his life but he is looking rough. Clinton never really ate that well in the first place, plus the stress of the most stressful job on the planet and it just did a number on his heart. He had a quadruple bypass in 2004 then had a followup heart surgery in 2005. Then again in 2010 he had to have two stents put into his heart. It was only after those stents were put in that Clinton became a vegan and really started looking after his health. The guy is on borrowed time, and has been for years. I honestly think he's going to pass before George H.W. Bush. At least H.W. was active for all those years on his ranch. Reminder: the sitting President is Bill Clinton's age.Trump has to be on something. He's overweight and doesn't believe in exercise and yet he still has more energy than me and I'm in my 20s.In the immortal words of Rick James, "Cocaine is one helluva drug"I don't think that cocaine is the secret to a long life.Nah, he's likely on some kind of amphetamine if he's on anythung. JFK was also on the same, mixing the speed with cortisone.Cocaine is actually maddeningly short acting, that's why the stereotype of coke heads doing multiple lines in quick succession exists. If Trump was doing coke, he'd be excusing himself every 20 min or less to do another bump.He needs to get on the Cheney diet.Is it Cheney's diet that enables him to live without a heart? What could he possibly be eating?Orphan soulsI'm angry about this, but only because you posted it faster than me.This is the guy who early on in his presidency went out on a jog in DC and ended up stopping at McDonalds. Any person would look rough after spending most of their life married to Hillary.Vegan diets don't add years to one's life. It does if the alternative was Bill's previous diet.That’s probably debatable. Calorie restrictions do, and hard to over eat broccoli [deleted]I think the person you are replying to is saying that he looks rough DESPITE his vegan diet,  not because of itKind of unclear tbh. Doesn't really matter though? The guy is getting pretty old, not surprising he is starting to look rough.Yeah, even GW Bush is looking a rough these days. 9 years ago he was the most powerful man on earth. Stress is a motherfucker of an aging cream.Yet somehow Putin chugs along endlesslydid he have a stroke or something? His health has been in the shitter for a couple years now.Yeah more than one IIRC. Turns out you can’t outrun cheeseburgers.Trump seems to be doing it, overweight, doesn't exercise, cheeseburgers...all doesn't seem to faze him.There's a painting of him in the White House attic that is looking worse by the day.  He found out the secret of Dorian Gray.Lewinksy sucked his soul out of him.Or Hillary. I prefer to think that Lewinski was blowing him back up like one of those inflatable pool rafts.Or the [Automatic Pilot](https://youtu.be/_WQfZYacEAw)!...or the inflatable autopilot in Airplane.He's old as hell and has dealt with 15 years of fallout from being a creep. All the STDs he collected are probably starting to take hold.Chlamydia, Herpes, Hepititis, AIDs, pick one"Read my lips: I slap asses"My Grandpa was a paster who immigrated to the US from England. He was a good man who was faithful to my Grandma for 50 years. He was never creepy or inappropriate. Until he turned 90. Once he got old he started to say wierd things. When he saw kids, even if we didn't know them, he would say things like "What a beautiful little girl! come sit on my lap". I know that he was well meaning but it was never taken that way by the mothers. It was really painful to see because I knew that this was not the man I knew my entire life. I really hope that was can respect that old people can end up like children. They lose the ability to reason what is appropriate and what is not. To the people who judge, I hope that you never see a loved one deteriorate mentally. It's rough. W Senior was a career politician. To make a statement this profoundly stupid he has to be either completely senile or just have no fucks left to give. Well, realistically speaking, how exactly are they going to punish him? Fine him? Sure, his net worth is in the $26M neighborhood. Imprison him? Not likely, he's at the tail end of his life and the charges probably wouldn't carry more than 30 days county jail even if he was 30 years old. Tarnish his reputation? His family already has a legacy that would overshadow this (take that whichever way you want).He's just a creepy, senile old man that likely knows he can chalk his behavior up to being a creepy, senile old man. He's almost a century old, I'm gonna go with no fucks left to give.  It's really, really gross what he did, but honestly what is anyone gonna do?  It's unfortunate but it's also reality.  &gt; It's really, really gross what he didIn this case I can't really judge him.  He's not all there.  It would be like claiming sexual assault if a toddler grabbed a titty.The current POTUS justified his own sexual assault/digital rape by calling it "locker room talk." Rich powerful men just don't care because 99% of the time there are no consequences.. “Women let me touch them.”“DIGITAL RAPE”Most of the women "let" Weinstein touch them too. It's funny that Trump apologists have gone from "he didn't mean it, it was just locker room talk" to "hell yeah he meant it but it's a great thing for him to do, go Trump grab those pussies".Grabbing women by the pussy is sexual assault unless they've made it clear that that's something they're okay with. In Trump's context, it's obvious that no one ever made that clear to him and he's just assuming. They "let him" do it because of his status. It's the same situation with Weinstein.Senile wheelchair bound 90 year old does inappropriate things, more at 11.EDIT: If a wheelchair bound 93 year old woman who can barely lift her arms grabbed me by the shaft and gave me a big old wink and nudge, I would have the maturity of character to realize that this person is likely not of sound mental and physical ability. My first reaction wouldn't be to take to the internet and tell everyone how horrible she was and how much I no longer respect her. I know that if I ever live to be 95 and I'm jerking off with my own feces, and winking at nurses, hopefully they won't embarrass me too much on the internet. Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm 30, I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting. Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergen's, and I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working.Mom’s spaghetti.Better sue New Zealand ^^with ^^^those ^^^^"rhymes."That's an awfully hot coffee pawt. But you could be working at Burger King, spitting on their onion rings.  Or alternatively in the parking circling, screaming I don't give a fuck with your windows down, and your system up. &gt; If a wheelchair bound 93 year old woman who can barely lift her arms grabbed me by the shaft and gave me a big old wink and nudge, I would have the maturity of character to realize that this person is likely not of sound mental and physical ability. The question, unfortunately, is are they doing it because their inhibitions are lower due to being less mentally sound than they used to be, or are they doing it because they know they can get away with it?(And I mean "they" as individual people, not as a group -- obviously some people are suffering from mental issues and some aren't -- it's just difficult to tell.)&gt; If a wheelchair bound 93 year old woman who can barely lift her arms grabbed me by the shaft and gave me a big old wink and nudgeHonestly, it might be worth it to let her continue...93 years of experience...Started a little young there, did she?well you know... those times were a little different. In China, Tu Yung is just a name.It took me entirely way too long to get this. Gods, I’m tired.I had an 85 year old woman shove her tongue in my mouth....twice.  It was a horrifying experience but you move on. I often have to work with patients in nursing homes, the ladies are just as handsy as the old men. Butt grabs are daily occurrence for any decent looking dude who works with the elderly. At least I haven't been been solicited for sex, being mistaken for a prostitute from the old days,  unlike some of my female co workers.Is it common knowledge that he's senile and has gone through significant mental decline for this behavior to be excusable? I haven't heard anything of the sort. There are definitely some older people out there who are still in their right mind at a very elderly age, so I don't think it's fair to just assume he's senile and write it off without knowing just how well he is. He suffers from a form of vascular Parkinson's disease. It isn't supposed to affect his mind but how can it not? It doesn't matter, he's a republican and this is Reddit. He was jumping out of planes a few years ago... not dismissing your point, but that dude has his faculties, if not now he did when he was slapping women on the buttWhen you're that old, even a few *months* can change things dramatically.My grandmother went from taking care of herself and my grandfather and having a small garden to needing a wheelchair and a full time caretaker in a matter of days. &gt;He was jumping out of planes a few years agoUh...it was more like pushing him out of the plane.&gt;**What is vascular parkinsonism?**People diagnosed with the condition walk with shuffling steps, and brain scans suggest they have suffered small strokes.     Looked this up when I read your post, TIL. Strokes can do some serious damage in a hurry. &gt; He was jumping out of planes a few years ago.More accurately, he was strapped to another person who jumped out of a plane.&gt;He was jumping out of planes a few years agoEveryone advised him against that to be fair, but he insisted. He still has enough clout for that kind of stuff apparently. Doing that at his age (then) may be a sign he was losing his faculties actually...i doubt it, degenerative diseases can happen quickly. but, on the other hand, if i was 95, i'd be bored as shit and not care about anyone's opinion. i think once someone is old enough, they should be allowed to get away with saying good bye to the pleasures of the flesh. i personally volunteer at old people's homes, letting old people grab my ass every weekend. I never completely believed that people of any age who jump out of airplanes have all of their mental faculties intact.[deleted]&gt;Is this inappropriate? Sure. Is it sexual assault? In my opinion, no.Your opinion on what it should be really doesn't matter, in plenty of states [groping](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/sexual-assault-overview.html) (if Bush did that is another story and so is if it should be considered sexual assault) is sexual assault. It is also worth pointing out that contrary to the Law and Order SUV intro not all sex crimes are especially heinous.&gt;I think a lot of people need to learn that there are levels of this stuffThere's levels of theft too, but just because stealing makeup isn't on the same level as robbing a bank doesn't mean it's not still theft. &gt;Is it sexual assault? In my opinion, no.Sure it is, it's just on the stealing-makeup level.   Sexual assault is any unwanted touching. It does not need to be threatening.Please familiarize yourself with this.http://www.casa.org.au/casa_pdf.php?document=what_is_SA&gt;**Unwanted touching** e.g. pinching, patting, embracing, rubbing, groping, flicking, kissing, fondling, being touchedon the breasts, bum, legs etc;Once you pass a certain age, it's like becoming a child again. 90 becomes like 9. If a 9 year old pats you on the butt, you deal with it like an adult and that's that. If you make it front page news, you're a pathetic, weak, attention seeking woman who needs help. We can't go overboard to the point that we're coddling adult woman as if they are deities who need to be worshipped and protected. Toughen up.Given the combination of the joke and the groping, it seems possible this is a move he pulled back in the day. Of course we won’t know unless more people come forward from earlier.It doesn't matter, he's a republican and this is reddit.If he's in such a poor condition, he should be kept under care or at least a watchful eye, not allowed to inappropriately touch others. This woman is not his caretaker, so that's a poor comparison. She did not expect to have her privacy violated when she agreed to appear near this man. If she had been aware that ass grabbing was involved, she may have stayed away, but she was not given that choice to make, was she? Damn, she must be really fragile. It's sooo traumatizing to have a wheelchair-bound senile person pat you on the butt and tell a bad dirty joke.It's about the overreaction.He went skydiving for his 90th birthday. He was quite well enough to do that. A wheelchair and senility are no excuse, especially when other actions he undertook showed him to be well enough to know better.So if he did it to a 20 year old would it be forgivable? 15? 10? What's the cut off for it to be ok for him to be a dirty old man?&gt; maturityYea... We don't really do that any more..This kind sounds like the 'boys will be boys' dismissal. Im not sure its okay to grab people without permission at any age... Do you think it is ok to grab people without their permission?A person with diminished responsibility can not be held to the same standards as someone who has full command of their faculties.He is old , his mind is failing and he will probably be dead in a year or two. We can acknowledge that it is wrong but in his case it is innocent since he can not comprehend how it is wrong.For real, America was basically prepping for his funeral a few months ago but somehow he beat pneumonia at 90yrs old. And had he passed and *THEN* this woman come out with this "shocking" allegation, well.... I can only imagine nobody would be stepping forward in that case.It’s not ok but it gives context. Basically he’s not a powerful man using his influence to exploit women. He’s just an old man who’s not all there in the head. Keep in mind just how old this man is. Again, that doesn’t make it ok, but I’d argue it’s not really comparable with the recent allegations in Hollywood. It's not the same yeah but patting women's rears is never okay to do in a professional world. That's just Mad Men 50's level sexism.Again, not really the same thing. It’s more of a pervy, senile old man who isn’t fully aware what he’s doing. Think of a kid grabbing at a woman’s breasts. This is more coming from my own history, I can't handle people I don't know touching me anyway, but I would imagine the doctors on his team would do some communication to him that it is not okay. Like children asking men with eyepatches if they're pirates, sometimes you're just not quick enough to avoid a charge embarrassing you.  And seriously, Mr. Pirate, thank you for giving him an "ARRRR."If it were a mentally-challenged individual would you be saying the same thing...have you ever seen or researched the brain of a 90yr old...they are comparable. He didn't do this in the professional world so that statement doesn't make much sense.Say the same thing how? Would I explain to them that touching other people that way is not okay? Yeah. No it's more like senile people do weird shit The person expressly says it is inappropriate. How does that translate to “okay”?No one said it's OK, but the man is 93 years old. Does this really need to come up? If some lady grabbed my junk 49 years ago, I'm not going to to shame her if she's half dead in a wheelchair.I’m with you on this. What is gained by shaming someone in his situation? Just grow up and get over it. You aren’t a god or a king. He grabbed your ass, so what. Dude. Really? Women should just put up with being sexually assaulted because it's no big deal? They should just grow up? You're so very wrong. .... that's your rationalisation? What is ok for you, is now the standard for everyone else? I asked if they thought it was ok to grab people without their permission, instead of answering you giving excuses why we should let George just get away with doing whatever ...? I clearly stated it wasn't, but I'm not going to shame someone who is almost 100 years old over it. And yes, I have been groped buy women. Life's not fair, fucked up shit happens. Buy a helmet.&gt;if some lady grabbed my junkYou clearly stated that your view is it's wrong that these women feel uncomfortable about being groped - because you wouldn't have a problem with it. No he didn't, he said it's wrong to run to the media and smear the lady's name over it.  So would you hold a 2 y/o to the same standard you would a 32 y/o?Understand the 'senility' part of this. The ability to do things like focus attention, understand social context or exercise impulse control can regress in people who have dementia - like GHW Bush. You probably think toddlers should be incarcerated for running around naked Timmy's naked again! The perversionHum. What does a kid running around naked have to do with an ex president playing grab ass? Are you seriously trying to suggest they are both the same level of innocent past time? They have damn near the same brain capacity at this point so yea.Senility and dementia cause the brain to revert to a child-like state. Adult body. Child's mind. So yes, you can't judge someone with senility by adult standards. They essentially are acting as a child would.We gonna start locking up senile 90 year olds or taking them to court?  Obviously it's not ok but what do you even do?All you have to do to avoid it is stay out of arms reach of the basically stationary object and maybe warn others to do the same.  If we're going to run every old man through the ringer it's going to be a long year.Damn I can't wait till I'm old and can do whatever I want because it would just be so impolite to hold old people accountable for crimes.If you make it to 93, I'll cut you some slack when you're completely off your gourd.  I don't understand how people don't understand this point. I'm fine with dragging the sexual assaulters. The H.W. stands for hiney wranglerThis excuse doesn't make it better.I don't even think it's an excuse. They're just saying he gropes women and expects them not to say anything or even like it.George H.W. Bush was also accused as part of the Franklin Sex Abuse Scandal back in the 1990s. You can read more about that here-http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegationsWell at least he admitted it?&gt; To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner.So they come out and admit he did what he was accused of, but try to pass it off as a “good-natured” groping?!??!  THAT’S the angle his PR team decided to take? Are they for real???What is the joke?&gt; ‘Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?’ As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, ‘David Cop-a-Feel!’Implying that he knows he's copping a feel. He's been dealing with a rarer kind of parkinsons and the typical issues of being 80+, but he's not shown too much in the way of mental degradation.I was passing this off as a doddering old dude who could only reach ass-high, but the joke definitely shows bad intent.  Too bad, he used to seem classier than this. EDIT:  according to a statement by the former president, his arm is ass-high, and and most ass touching is involuntary, but sometimes it wasn't.  He tells the Cop-a-feel joke to break the tension.  &gt; most ass touching is involuntaryIt's called damage control, bro.That's what I'm going to start calling it!I think that's one thing we should take away from this, even if we learn nothing else. People who we thought were classy in other respects can be the ones that do this kind of thing. It isn't just the skeezy guy at the Christmas party that everyone avoids. It's also the normal, every day people that "would never do that, so she/he must be making it up." We do it on reddit too. When some church pastor or youth leader is accused of something, people brigade, asking how dumb that community must be. Outside the crazy cults and evangelical leaders, they're mostly like everyone else though. It sounds like he's pretty much admitted that this was a pattern, rather than something he once did during a senile episode. If that's the case, we need to make sure people realize that it's not okay, even if it's in "good humor" or was "just a misunderstanding." That's essentially what this actress is doing. She's not saying he's a bad person or that he is some crazy predator that needs to be locked up. It sounds like she was just pointing all those things out to say "hey it could be anyone" as well as asking for him to publicly say it was wrong.   It's not okay now. You have to think of now. In the past, doing that was considered okay. People don't realize that older people don't have the same mindset as the younger crowd. &gt; Implying that he knows he's copping a feel. If Obama was 80+, had brain problems and started groping women while making inappropriate remarks... All the Republicans in this comment thread would be staying up late to tie the nooses they intend to leave on their black co-worker's desk in the morning. You know, to show how much they hate what Obama did with a 'friendly joke' at the office.politics on the brain...The point is that it's not okay to just pat someone's rear. From an interview with another actress, Jordan’s Grolnick, the joke was:Q: ‘Do you know who my favorite magician is?’ A: ‘David Cop-A-Feel’Source: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/george-hw-bush-camp-says-he-patted-womens-rears-in-…-a-good-natured-manner/ar-AAu3PsPThe joke is that nobody cares because (R).The punchline is that socked in the gut feeling when you realize it's not actually a joke.Or maybe because some of us take care of our senile relatives.He's 95. Good for him he's not a biter nor a poop thrower.In context of #MeToo this should not give us insight about sexual abuse but rather the constant harassment nurses and care takers endure when taking care of old people.Somehow the majority of 95 year olds manage to not grab ass when meeting strangers. Ummm... How many 95 year olds do you know? Because the ones I do tend to have ran out of fucks to give a long time ago. Bush fought in WW2, became a congressman, ambassador, CIA director, then Vice President, then President, but now he must die in disgrace because at the age of 93, stricken by Parkinson's and partially senile, he touched someone's butt.*Die in disgrace* is a bit harsh, but I also don't think mocking anyone who calls it inappropriate is the correct reaction either.Well it's not like he can pat their shoulders now.One part of me is highly disappointed seeing as I've always thought of HW as a real class act. The other part of me recognizes that he's old as shit at this point and is questionably all there, so it's hard for me to judge him that harshly. Maybe that's wrong or irrational, but it's like trying to draw judgement on a child.The final part is also just wondering what the point of this whole fiasco is. Are we looking for prosecutions? Public shaming? An argument? To remind everyone has a scummy side? I just can't get invested in this story without knowing what the message is...&gt;Maybe that's wrong or irrational, but it's like trying to draw judgement on a child.There's a reason Western societies place a substantial emphasis on intent with criminal law, and also why we don't typically charge minors as adults.[deleted]To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner.From an interview with another actress, Jordan’s Grolnick, the joke was:Q: ‘Do you know who my favorite magician is?’A: ‘David Cop-A-Feel’Source: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/george-hw-bush-camp-says-he-patted-womens-rears-in-…-a-good-natured-manner/ar-AAu3PsPNo one is making anything up. That's a statement literally from his PR team.What in the fuck are you talking about?He just admitted to it, though. Through a very half-assed statement, I might add. If his people knew he was doing this, then they should have kept him away from these women.So, when he admits it, you still think it's an accusation without proof?He admitted he grabs women's asses and you're going on about "rape hysteria with no proof"... One of these things is not like the other.The [original story](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/78nddy/former_president_george_hw_bush_accused_of_sexual/), of course, was filled with the usual Reddit comments suggesting the first accuser made this all up (because women are evil), mistook a 'tap from his wheelchair' for assault (because women are dumb), or that she just wanted to be famous or sue him (because women are greedy).OK, I'm an older woman who has lived through the 80s as an attractive young woman. Back then, sexual harassment was, simply a given. It wasn't "Oh my god! I was sexuality harassed!' It.was, "Ugh, another day, another dollar, dodging creeps and  pretending to the powerful yucks that they *might* have a chance. Just to get the job/promotion where I was already proven qualified. Or worse, getting offers of undeserved promotions based on sex exchange. At that point, you know that you are the worst kind of hooker, one who sells her body and 8 hours a day doing something she's just not qualified to do. I never took those up, but, I'm pretty sure the women that did suffered. Anyway, that was life. It was accepted. When  Anita Hill tossed a fit about the public  hair on a coke can, I though she was a sheltered little princes. I'm like, "Really? That's all he did and now it's a big deal? Lol, that's nothing...you whimp!"Yes...that was my first response. Shit on Anita because she wasn't willing to deal with a 10th of what real people deal with. I'm so glad she won!The workplace has gotten better and better over time. No longer feel like I have to stroke my  bosses ego, I just have to produce good work. It's fantastic! But, I will say that the culture of flirt/fiddle/manipulate/or just joke about  WTF was such a social norm back then, that I can't be super mad at the slow to learns. There's NO EXCUSE now. None, we've all been plenty educated. The ones who do it now simply assume they are above human decency and the law. But the ones who did it in the way, way, back....ugh...I can't crucify them. That's how society was. It wasn't OK, but it what it was. Thank you for adding context to the conversation.So many view sex as currency. How devalued that makes us all.I agree, prostitution should be legal.It should, actually.We should reclassify sex work as labor like any other, deserving of the respect that other work carries. &gt;or that she just wanted to be famous or sue himDid you even read what she said about it? She was totally putting herself on a pedestal.&gt; the first accuser made this all up (because women are evil)Indeed. There are literally no cases of a woman ever making up sex assault allegations against a rich/powerful/privileged person for gain, spite or grins.It has never happened.Any skepticism towards any sexual harassment story is misogyny. Any request for due process of the accused is ‘re-victimization’ of the accuser.Always believe any accuser.Always demand blood from any accused.Always.So why do you think at least four women report him using the same “David Cop-a-feel” joke over the course of years before grabbing their asses?&gt; Always demand blood from any accused.Could you be any more melodramatic?And they claim women are emotional and overly dramatic...It is pretty weird when the thing that upsets them most is abusers getting called out. what happens more... in your world view? Women being sexually harassed? Or women making up a story about being sexually harassed? &gt;There are literally no cases of a woman ever making up sex assault allegations against a rich/powerful/privileged person for gain, spite or grins.The ol' reddit "put words in the mouth of someone to make them seem silly" trick.If you are skeptical, maybe just say that? The comments /u/pr0nto is referring to were mostly ridiculous. Saying she was doing it for fame or to further her own career.I can't think of many instances where publicly claiming sexual misconduct has really vaulted the woman into the place she wanted to be in her career.Being skeptical is fine, but maybe keep the color commentary around the skepticism to yourself? It is a useful lesson to both sides. There is a difference between being skeptical and calling the woman a lair who is making it up for publicity.  Yes.  Which is why this argument is wrong:   A: "I'm sceptical of these claims. "   B: "Are you calling her a liar? "This is such an extreme version of strawmanning. You are going out of your way to paraphrase your opponents in a way that no one would ever agree with. I really think it would be more effective to say with precision what you think, rather than rephrase with imprecision things you don’t think. It’s harder, of course.So what do you make of Corey Feldman's $10M Indiegogo campaign?  Some aging has-been trying to get some publicity by claiming a pedo ring is operating inside a major Hollywood studio? I mean, he can't name anyone because libel laws, so why should anyone believe him? Obviously never happened, right?  *Right*? It is imagined that a man would never fabricate sexual assault allegations because it is too embarrassing and emasculating. A man who is raped in prison is literally called "a bitch."But a woman is assumed to be after a male accuser's good name until proven otherwise (by 39 other women or so) and elevating her own in sainted victimhood.In our society, men have nothing to prove, but women must prove everything.&gt; he can't name anyone because libel lawsUS libel laws are plaintiff unfriendly compared to other countries; someone suing Feldman would have to convince a jury by a preponderance of the evidence that he was lying.That said, I certainly want to hear his claims, evidence, corroboration, etc. It’s the only way this thing wil ever be resolved, potentially.I haven’t heard about and don’t know why he’s raising money, however. I'm not saying the reaction to the original accusation should be "Lock him up!" but it's disgusting to see someone get 6000 net upvotes, gilded, and dominate the comments with actual made-up bullshit like:&gt;In this case "sexual assault" is tapping her from behind in his wheelchair while Barbara was right next to him and telling her a "dirty joke". The way people are loosely using "sexual assault" these days is abhorrent. It diminishes real sexual assaults and victims.Reddit is home to a number of large, misogynistic subreddits and it's foolish to think their members don't have influence on many of the default subs as well. (Not to suggest that the original commenter is necessarily one of those types)Until 20-50 women come forward we should probably write it off.Putting a pin in the Bush family nostalgia, let's hope.Someone in the original thread was calling allegations of sexual assault "trendy."I have no mouth and i must scream.It's really not that hard people. Don't touch people if they don't want to be touched. Would have to say this is the best possible response HW could have made.If you f-up, admit itAnd they aren't. And rather than anyone else saying 'yep this situation is bad' they're all going 'but but but dementia' even a simple question like 'do you think it's wrong to touch people without permission' is downvotes. Because reddit is fucking toxic some days. Shrug. Says more about you that you're defending sexual assault. What the actual fuck is going on with reddit today? Two threads about George H.W. Bush sexually assaulting a woman, one of the threads is an actual confirmation by himself that the allegations are 100% correct and yet both threads are completely filled with dismissals and apopogists! This is a disgusting show of character for this site and it's users. Everyone on the "circle jerk of the Bush's lately" cause they said mean things about Trump. The comments in here are hilarious, so many apologists. Yeah we have a highly upvoted comment in this thread claiming to be a rape survivor who is saying that this is "rape hysteria" and acting like it's a made up thing, when the fucking article is his PR team saying he did it. InsanityNo, but really, it's OK because he's old and senile! /sMy grandpa got this way in his old age and it was fucking traumatizing and the worst part was knowing that he wasn't even fucking aware of half of it. But it also didn't totally excuse his behavior and we started taking precautions to keep it from happening. I think the dismissals are because the article has presented this as sexual assault, but it's not that....it's miles away from that. This is sexual harassment, which is not appropriate, but it's not a sexual assault. Blurring the distinction between the two is a problem. [deleted]A bad rap?  2 Live CrewSo, what's going to happen?  Nothing?  Right.What do you recommend be done to him?I mean what would you do? The guy's 93 lol. It's not exactly like he's all there.Wow. What a piece of crap. If it was good natured, HW, you'd be patting backs, not asses. I'll be the first to admit he can't pat someone on the back, but that doesn't mean you pat asses and make a joke about copping a feel.It's controversial because you *aren't* condoning sexual assault. If somebody told me this is what the 21st century would be like, I wouldn't have believed them.He's 93 and wheel chair bound. Can he even reach their backs?Can he reach backs?
I don’t trust twitter to decide what content I should and should not see. When I joined twitter it was just a chronological timeline of tweets from everyone I followed now it’s a jumbled mess where the algorithm hides tweets from “bad people” or hides tweets that it thinks I shouldn’t see. So..don't use Twitter for news. Just use it for the chronogical timeline of tweets from people you follow. Its not like twitter is taking Sputnik or RT away from the internet - they're deciding to not do business with other businesses they don't like.  That's how business works.[removed]Trying way too hard man.I support getting rid of 30,000 pic less Trump-bots and I also support the creators of those bots getting flesh-eating bacteria in their dickhole s [deleted]Hey, we voted him in. No buyers remorse here, at least it's entertaining. [removed][deleted][removed]Do you even know what Sharia law is? Or did you just form a half baked idea of what it is from Fox News sound bites?[removed]Then you know it's not actually a legal system, but rather a system of religious traditions which is voluntarily adopted by it's adherents, and cannot be forced upon the unwilling.[removed]So you're just going to troll me rather than engage in any real discussion on the topic? I don't know why I thought any better of you, my mistake.Also my beard is majestic, and stops at my jawline. I work in a freezer and wear a face mask, so hair on my neck gets really scratchy. Though now that you mention it I suppose it could use a little trimming up. Thanks for the reminder.[removed][deleted]Does this placate you leftists conspiracy theorists?Twitter off the hook now for indirectly (and absolutely without consent or intent) helping Trump get elected by using the platform. Twitter off the hook now that ~~we~~ they wont sell advertisements to a couple of media outlets? Literally THOUSANDS of dollars of ads!Sincerely, Jack Dorsey.(We think you're stupid enough that this might work)So they are pulling the contract because of election interference. Which is still inconclusive? Take the moral high ground over the fincial gain. Nice to hear
Why can't they make a robot to look like Number 5 from short circuit?I'd totally shop there more if they had short circuit robots roaming around.Johnny Five&gt; Why can't they make a robot to look like Number 5 from short circuit?It's because robot builders correctly assume that once Skynet takes over the nostalgia from the Short Circuit movies would prevent the human resistance from firing upon the army of killbots.Duh. Which is why its ridiculous when corps "need" tax breaks to create more jobs when the jobs of their future are robots. I can't wait for somebody to "accidently"  get pushed by one of this robots.Like 400 pounds of cellulite on one of those carts?Now if Walmart can just find a way to make the robots buy products they can eliminate workers - and customers. Efficiency is wiping out starting level jobs in today's market.  Where do the companies think the lower and middle class consumer's money comes from? Retraining doesn't cover the losses.$15 hour starting level jobs are a real incentitive for automation.Yes, but they are short sighted incentives. The service industry employs a large amount of Americans. If automation happens too fast, the drop in employment would be catastrophic to the economy. If automation occurs but there is no place to absorb those workers, same scenario. So while industries may see a short term growth, they ultimately will see declining profits.What's Wal-Mart going to do when all the robot scanners and robot greeters try to unionize This joke sucks, thousands are going to lose the only job they are qualified for. This is the tip of the iceberg. Lots of poverty on the horizon. Lots. This is the tip of the iceberg not simply for jobs but for the structure we live in. When human jobs are replaced by robots, what salaries will be used to purchase the products and services the robots peddle? *Accelerationism intensifies*That's when we reach the singularity and become robots to get jobs while our virtual consciousness surfs Reddit to bitch about all the sex we can't have that we weren't getting anyway.Only takes a few years of poverty for starvation and death to set in. It won’t take that long for most humans to be gone. Jesus that's depressing.I agree. Lots of random and sporadic violence too. Mental instability.We've been automating millions upon millions of jobs since WWII and yet we're at historic lows for unemployment.Hmmmm...The alternative is keeping a soul crushing "job" where you know the only reason you're needed is because someone pities your poverty and pays you an insultingly low wage to drive home the fact that a robot can do it better cheaper.How's it going to know how many of an item is on the shelf when they're stacked and "faced". Just look at the [picture from the article](https://imgur.com/ByCA50Q). Those end caps don't even have labels that it can scan, just the price sign up above. I count at least 7 different types of cake mix on that end cap. It won't know how many of each type is on the shelf, or if one in the back is a Betty Crocker mix instead of a Pillsbury that someone stuffed back there when they passed the end cap and saw the cheaper price. &gt;The approximately 2-foot (0.61-meter) robots come with a tower that is fitted with cameras that scan aisles to check stock and identify missing and misplaced items, incorrect prices and mislabeling. Notifying someone to correct mislabels and incorrect prices seems fine, but how does it know if something is misplaced. Can it tell the difference between Strawberry and Cherry Koolaid from looking at the front of the packaging? That Koolaid on the top shelf, taller than the robot, how does it know how many bottles are behind the front ones? This works in a controlled factory, but a store with customers wrecking it every day like wal-mart customers do, there's no way this robot is going to keep anything straight except for incorrect pricing on the shelf labels maybe. Seems more like a gimmick than something that will actually do what they want it to do. They're just trying to say "look we're exactly like Amazon, we're not behind at all. Please keep buying our stock."Yes... And will they be able to tell if a package is damaged or out of date?Employees will be expected to stack the products in accordance with new shelving guidelines. Any damaged boxes found on shelves, or out of date product will result in immediate disciplinary action. Like a spanking?I don't see how they would be able to. These are just shelf label price check machines. And I don't remember ever having much of a problem with prices being wrong from shelf to checkout. So it's an complicated solution to a almost non-existent problem. Just a gimmick really, to make them seem like they're keeping up with tech like Amazon. Just a tech race then?We need to implement some kind of universal system to compensate since every lower to middle-lower class job will be robotized. Something like a universal education system so people can get new skills for free, or maybe universal human income assuming all those test cases they are running actually work.Oh, you mean like welfare?  That's a great idea!  Put everyone on welfare. Pay them just enough to shop at the Walmart to keep the robots busy and the Walton's wealthy.  And if they give us any guff, we'll get our buddies at Anthem/United Health Care to prescribe them painkillers and mood stabilizers until they are too fucking stoned to think.Yay! Capitalism!So now you work for robots.Politics and 'The Economics of Automation^^TM ' aside, I wish those robots looked a lot cuter. They're pretty plain and sort of ghastly to look at \^\^;
Why even invite them to compete? Real question.Because the International Judo Federation is in charge of who qualifies. It's not like the host country just invites whoever they want to come/are OK with coming. UAE wants to host the competition because it benefits them economically and maybe somewhat socially, like most countries who want to host sports competitions. IJF gives them the competition to host this year and says "well you have to be nice to the Israelis." So they do the bare minimum of letting them in but refuse to play the anthem/let them use their flag because the competition has already started and they won't get in trouble for it (at least it doesn't seem like it; maybe IJF will give them a suspension or something).It's like your mom telling you that you can't have a sleepover unless you let your little brother hang out with you and your friends. You agree it because you want the party, but once it's started, you ignore your little brother because you don't like him, and give him the XBox controller that isn't even plugged in.Thanks for the thorough explanation, makes total sense.I'm sure the thought of beating up Jews without consequence was attractive to them.(I'd put an /s but... I'm *kind of* serious?)I don't think it was the case... Israeli team got 4 medals at the last judo grand prix, so I think UAE knew they were a strong contender for the gold... They tried to outmaneuver Israel by putting some artificial ridiculous restrictions (like no printing Israel on their clothes, etc.), hopeful Israeli team would get offended and wouldn't come. But Israelis came anyway and won :-)The best kind of winning :)They other competitors knew who beat them, that's what counts. They didn't lose to the "International Judo Federation," they lost to a Jew and they know it.Judo should be renamed to Jewdo.Man I would not want to be in charge of that physical security team.Israelis consistently do well in these martial arts especially against fighters from Muslim countries. Endless controversies that show just how childish the people in these countries are. International sports organizations should not allow any nation to host an event if they don't agree to treat every nation equally.  Too bad international sports organizations care only about money.Is he a Jewish Israeli? What the fuck difference does that make?I think the story would be a lot more interesting if he was a Muslim. I think it's a lot more fun seeing these anti-Semitic assholes getting beaten by a Jew.[deleted]If you're going to say something like that, you better back it up with valid sources.[deleted]That's not exactly a solid source for your argument. That's like me linking to wikipedia's home page to argue, well, anything. [deleted]&gt; That's like me linking to wikipedia's home page to argue, well, anything.Sorry to have to repeat myself, but I will.You started this thread with a high-degree of expressed confidence and immediately responded with a wildly generalized list and "I don't know it very well". Methinks your overconfidence is unfounded.[deleted]No. I don't care if it's "the internet", that's not how arguing works. You assert a thing, you source a thing if asked, or it stops being valid. Otherwise using your logic, well, "You're wrong". Now prove me wrong. Your logic states I have no obligation to back that up. So it's a fact: You're just wrong. [deleted]K. You're clearly just here to troll around now, not discuss a thing, so I'm gonna leave. Bye now.No because nobody wins when arguing with a retard.One of the alleged "discriminatory laws" is a postage stamp with a menorah on it. Give me a break. That is not discrimination.Yes because clearly income tax laws are discriminatory......... against everyone except the govt It's the section that gives you a 35% exemption if you promote "zionist settlement" is the discriminatory part. That is like saying you get an extra $100 on your tax return if you keep a Trump sign in your yard.No, its not. Its like saying you get a tax break if you build new homes in rural areas. Also known as a super common and normal thing in many places. cry more
The government *literally* took his land and doesn't want to pay fair value for the land or for telling him he couldn't use it. Land being dirt. He sells dirt for a living. They took it for levees and told him he was no longer allowed to sell it in the process, causing him to lose business.Did that levee management policy exist before he purchased that land or is it an entirely new phenomena?Edit: Phrasing
I assume almost nothing of value is going to come from these documents. However that will not stop me from reading every single thing that is released.It's possible they could let something slip by. Operation Northwoods was never supposed to be released to the public but it slipped through the cracks unredacted on one of their other big dumps and now it's common knowledge.Pretty sure all this stuff being made public is finally gonna reveal what really happened, and put the RISICULOUS theories to rest.Basically, there was no shooter, his head just kinda did that. Open and shut.&gt;...his head just kinda did that. Open and shut.Well, not so much with the shut part.Oh beansWell, more-so just open, really.&gt;his head just kinda did that. **Open and shut**.I think it was the other way around. Hilarious and original!Sorry Moses40 days in the wilderness for you!Not again! I'll pack my bagsWell that or it’ll come to light that there really wasn’t some master conspiracy, just a disallusioned young man with a rifle and good aim. Then it if that was the case, no need to withhold informationThere could have been real reasons to keep the info classified immediately following the assassination. Things like the fbi/ss not wanting people to know weaknesses in their protection protocol, stuff like that. However, after the investigation was done and any holes were filled in their security were filled (I’m guessing they’re doing a much better job since Kennedy since there hasn’t been a successful assassination since then) they should’ve released all the info to quiet conspiracy theories. Yeah some people think they’re really smart and will keep making them, but when the government hides that shit for like 40 years... it becomes questionable. Questionable as fuck. There could be other reasons as well.  Like investigating possible outside actors such as the Soviets and Cubans.  The means of that investigation would be classified for a very long time.  God like aim, that rifle is crap beyond 100yardsAll three shots were well within 100yd. And remember, one missed. Also:&gt;FBI firearms expert Robert A. Frazier testified that "It is a very accurate weapon. The targets we fired show that."[62] From 15 yards (14 m), all three bullets in a test firing landed approximately 2½ inches high, and 1-inch (25 mm) to the right, in the area about the size of a dime (0.705 inch diameter).[63] At 100 yards (91 m), the test shots landed 2½ to 5 inches (130 mm) high, within a 3 to 5-inch (130 mm) circle. Frazier testified that the scope's high variation would actually work in the shooter's favor: with a target moving away from the shooter, no lead correction would have been necessary to follow the target. "At that range, at that distance, 175 feet (53 m) to 265 feet (81 m),[64] with this rifle and that telescopic sight, I would not have allowed any lead — I would not have made any correction for lead merely to hit a target of that size."I have one. Mine is actually pretty accurate out to about 150-200 yards. Not bubba'd or anythingThat's what I've come to believe News flash....Oswald killed Kennedy If you think Lee Harvey Oswald was the only person in the world who woke up on November 22nd, 1963 who knew the President was about to be assassinated, than I have a bridge to sell you.E. Howard Hunt was the CIA guy who setup both JFK and RFK's killingsAnd where was George H. Bush on the day JFK was shot?  He doesn’t remember but it was TexasOl' George was probably just grabbin' a few keisters somewhere in Dallas.He was probably seeing his favorite magician, David-Cop-A-Feel....probably in Tennessee — that says, shoot me once, shame on — shame on you. Shoot me — you can't get shot twice.And what about Obama?!? Why wasn't he in the Oval Office that day? Hmmmm.....Yeah, good luck with that accusation.Was JFK planning to tell the American public about the Roswell alien crash?  Well, we can't have that...You know Trump had to have asked and is probably fuming that the Air Force "lied" to him and won't tell him about the aliens.Yeah, turns out he shot Kennedy.  Who knew...They almost release these every year... And never do.Lol what? This release date has been planned for years.I think this is a deadline. Agencies likely could have pulled the trigger  whenever they wanted to.
So a mountain lion was found in the mountains where there is known mountain lions. What's the story here?It one and a half!And adorable!Well in this region, there's somewhat of a problem with inbreeding. The mountain lions are trapped in by the freeways, which makes it very hard for them to find new territories of their own.If this particular mountain lion is unrelated to those that live there already, then there's much needed genetic diversity being introduced.So, a year old puma; but does it have two heads or two asses?I was expecting a sneaker
What kind of monster hates Canadian beer this much? Horrific. 
I guarantee who ever did this, has zero knowledge of what Teddy did for the national park service.I assume most vandals are just idiots anyway.Not to mention worker’s rights, curbing corporate monopolization, nature conservation and food safety The last true Republican progressive.Maybe, they really just don't like Robin Williams.So most adults up until he died?^sorry^guysHave you seen his stand-up? It's so adult it needs a shave.Kind of like his back.Would that grant an excuse for something terrible he did? Powerful people make decisions that end up hurting people regardless of intent. Finding victim hood is the only growing industry in 2017, I’m sure there are plenty of things to freak out about what Teddy did under the prism of 2017. Perhaps it would be more constructive if we started (or continued) pushing back on people trashing historical figures unless they were, say, Hitler or Stalin.  Or, even better, we pushed back against any attempt to reduce issues at large to soundbytes and boiling all nuance out of them. What bothers me is that every generation is going to have a problem with the way generations prior did things. Vandalizing all of these monuments serves no point other than denying our evolution to what we are today.Slippery slope, but are we going to start vandalizing natural history museums because cave men were believed to be a tad rapey and possessive?This obsession with altering the past is really just a sad and introspective look at how people feel they have no control over their future.I think it's also part and parcel to a society where fact is no longer respected, and there's no filter. We don't trust science or education because we no longer have a filter between it and us. Get on the internet, and you can say anything, and someone, somewhere will believe it. Only, now you have a much bigger stage and microphone.And people say that only the 2nd Amendment is dangerous. Harumph. They probably didn’t even realize who it was. Just saw a statue and went for it.Preserve his favorite hunting grounds?What did Teddy do that the 'anti-statue' crowd would have a problem with?“I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every ten are, and I shouldn’t like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth.”   -Theodore RooseveltIn his defense, he got shot at a lot.I guess maybe this is where they are going.  So trust busting, elimination of government corruption, the national parks service, and the panama canal are just more 'white people stuff'.  Who said that? I was just pointing out a possible reason why people who protest statues of racists wouldn't like him.I said it.When defacing a statue you're basically saying what you don't like about the person (presumably an issue with native americans) outweighs other accomplishments.I think you're actually saying that your own opinion about the statue or its subject outweighs the opinions of those who erected the statue, the opinions of those who like the statue or its subject, the rule of law, and the political process.Even if that's the case, why would it mean that people who defaced the statue see those things as "white people stuff"? To me, it seems like an attempt to accuse people of being against those things as well as his racism.Haha. There's a group of toughs that ramble around towns and at the mere sight of a statue become incensed to the point of turning vandal. Even local burger joints ain't safe, they say Ronald McDonald had it coming.Fake news!      There's only one perpetrator..... the Hamburglar They may have confused him with the Roosevelt who allowed citizens to be rounded up and put in prison camps. He did hunt a lot of big game.[After leaving the presidency in 1909, Roosevelt cast further afield, embarking first on an epic 11-month, 2,500-mile safari... trapping or shooting over 11,000 animals, including everything from insects to the largest of game—elephants, hippos, and white rhinos.](http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/site/c.elKSIdOWIiJ8H/b.8344379/k.2B69/The_Hunter.htm)What's the best round for an insect?Oo oo, I know this one! A FULL-BORE SLUG!Depends if you want to recover the body or not I guess.700 Nitro Express double rifle. That's true, but not something this group has been known to have an issue with previously. Let me guess...he touched a woman's petticoat inappropriately in 1901?A [group of ladies has taken affront](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/intoxication/art/intoxication-lips-touch-liquor) to his loose lips in regard to libations. ;-)“Hate will not be tolerated,” the unidentified vandal wrote on the Columbus statue along with “#somthingscoming.”Sounds like guerrilla marketing for a new West Side Story movie.Yeah, "Hate will not be tolerated" while displaying your hatred of a historical figure. Good job, you've proven you're an idiot on many levels vandal.&gt;somthingscomingI hope it’s a spelling book.Could be. Who knows?"it'll only be confederate statues we totally swearsies"inb4 protest against The Lincoln Memorial.These really are just closet anarchist digging for reasons to hate everyone.There's already been graffiti on the Lincoln Memorial.[I mean, we're close.](http://reason.com/archives/2017/10/16/not-even-lincoln-is-spared-the-wrath-of)&gt;reasons to hate everyone.To be honest, we probably all deserve it.Not saying that we won't be faced with demands of statue removals for Founding Fathers (has happened, IIRC) or other figures, but I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't realize that TR's statue wasn't a confederate statue.“The mayor has opened [a] panel, looking at the question of statues. We refer people to that.”That requires that you be able to articulate a rational objection.Hence the red paint instead.http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/10/26/teddy-roosevelt-statue-vandalized/For non Fox News fans here’s the local story for the other side.

At this point your cause means nothing to me if you use a hashtag. Lame stuff guys. these democrats are terrorists. Well at least they're not slitting throats and ramming cars into crowds.It must have been someone with an agenda, it couldn't possibly have been just some random agendaless moron.Even doing it for "shits and giggles" would still be a motive lol. Just look at anarchists. There is a difference between agenda and motiveI don't think you understand anarchismAre you saying "stirring the kettle" isn't having an agenda? Just as trolling may seem mundane it has a purpose, to get a response, to sow the seeds of discontent. ;) Удачи Америка!Shits and giggles is not the same as "stirring the pot" 
I think it's just bad timing and sensationalism. The Reagan is anchored off Busan, and heads up Seventh Fleet, while Nimitz is rotating home from the Persian Gulf(homeport at NB Kitsap), and the Stick(TR) is expected to replace her in the Middle East. As usual, the media is completely clueless in regards to standard military procedure. Boom boom beat the drums of war.Cry havok and let slip the hogs of war. Whatever farm animals of war!Quite a lot of force gathered together in one place.Except it is not one place.  The T Roos just chopped to 7th fleet, meaning she just crossed the intl date line; the Reagan is off the Korean peninsula, and the Nimitz is in the Indian Ocean - they are thousands of miles from each other Given they could be in close proximity of each other in 1-2 days given how fast they move, it might as well be.let that be a warning to the commie bastards in Pyongyang and Beijing. they shouldn't try nothing stupid.This could turn into a real disaster....or be completely inconsequential.Yeah, diplomacy is still an option. Since they’ve said their nuclear program is only a deterrent, I’d hope we just live with it. The Olympics are soon too. Maybe there’ll be nothing till after.A deterrent to anyone wanting to do something about a regime so scummy they counterfeit dollars and sell meth. The regime that is directly responsible and the first one to take all military action since the Korean War. Let's not sugarcoat that the DPRK is just wanting to survive and live peacefully. They are most definitely not. Agree, and something to keep in mind: if little Kim survives, he has another fifty years of dictatorship ahead of him. So what’s the agenda?Anyone seriously believe all he’s going to use his nukes for is preventing conflict?Starting to think the regime’s world view is essentially racist. They’ve talked for example of sinking Japan into the sea by nuclear means. I get history, past conflicts and abuses, but at this point why - other than sheer irrational hatred?I would guess this is just a show of force to remind fat kim not to try anything while he is in the regionShips pass in the night... Sometimes three Carriers occupy the Asian Pacific simultaneously.
This is a truly strange story. It says that the helicopter was travelling from a mine that was abandoned in 1998. Why were they there in the first place? Even stranger, it says an almost identical crash involving the same type of helicopter happened in 2008.Probably gonna sound like a dick but I do not really see the mystery. It is not a mine, it is a mining town. And according to Wikipedia : "Since 2007 there have been efforts to make it a tourist attraction." so that might explain why people where visiting? And the helicopter they where flying in has been produced from 1961 until present day. When you build a helicopter for 56 years then there is a much bigger chance of "almost identical" crashes which I choose to read as "Similar". Going by your comment I knew it was a Mi-8. Yeah, it's a bit like a Ford F-Series being involved in an accident in the US.Get to em before the cold does. Did they rescue the people?Not yet. They have probably located the wreckage, but they'll need a sub to get down to it. Norway is working on it, the wreckage is at 200 m depth.Did they have scuba equipment on that helicopter? Otherwise, it seems like more of a *recovery* than a *rescue*. Trying to prevent one of it's many ticking time bombshttp://m.dw.com/en/working-together-to-defuse-russias-nuclear-timebomb/a-3036461Why the fuck is Russia anywhere near Svalbard? No worries, I'm sure they will be rescued by the armoured bears. 
What a poorly written headline. I initially thought CVS's revenue was more than the $66 billion that was bid for them.Not that it matters but it is! They make over $170b per year in revenue. For what it’s worth I didn’t get that impression from the headline but I understand how one could. 
Next up; water is wet and fire is hot.I have to say, I am totally nonplussed by this stunning analysis.
A two person firm?  Let me guess, it's Billy McFarland and Ja Rule, the guys who organized the Fyre Festival?Stop work over an audit? Are they going for the biggest red flag world record?Not really. Audits can be quite taxing on a business when they have to devote man power and resources to providing all the proper documents/credentials necessary. I mean this firm had only two full time employees, one of them is probably the only person who knows where all the proper documents are. lolLol right? Like don't they literally only have 2 contracts under their belt?Its only 2 people period, working for the company when the contract was awarded.  50% of the people working there had ties to Trump (1).((Citation missing))hmmm, I was wondering why r/The_Donald was leaking..I think you're misreading comments.Yeah, this seems like a fuck up in government auditing. Nothing actually malicious, but a fuck up. I've also seen some decent work from some no name companies, so who knows, at least they're not amateurs.if you can't handle an audit and continue the work, maybe you shouldn't have the contract...Has nothing to do with the size of the companies, audits are always a bitch and people are always complaining.   &gt; Has nothing to do with the size of the companieshow? if one person has to deal with an audit and the company has 1 employee, that leaves 0 to do work.  compared to a company of 100+, size does matter.The company doesn't just have two employees. The joke was because there was only two full time employees, but that was a while back.She called for more than just an audit,  She called for the contract to be immediately voided. Which seems to be something that people are glossing over.&gt;"The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said in an interview with Yahoo News Tuesday.[San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/news/economy/whitefish-san-juan-mayor/)She's saying their threatening to not do the work they've been contracted to do when she's made it clear she doesn't want them to be contracted to do that.  Them not doing the work would be a natural consequence of having the contract terminated.  They were essentially asking, "since you don't want us to be doing the work, should we stop now or what?"Edit: This article is really poorly written.  It's sort of jumbling up the audit request from the Governor, and the feud with the mayor which are fairly distinct. The Governor and the Mayor of San Juan are not the same people and are not asking for the same thing.Why do they always say "This doesn't represent us"? Yeah, it does. You said it. You did it. It represents you. Just because what you said was shitty doesn't mean you get to pretend you aren't shitty. I'm confused. I thought that she *wants* them to quit working.She wants them to not get paid. She still wants them to do the work.&gt; Just because what you said was shittyI'm pretty sure the person advocating for canceling a contract that would result in her people being without power a lot longer is the shitty one here.  These things don't happen out of thin air.  Cancel this contract and it will be months before bids are submitted, evaluated, a contract written, and workers deployed.   Meanwhile people will die. Is it too much to ask to have a local contractor who might be familiar with the people, the local setup, the local region, etc. be involved?   But you know damn well that is not going to happen with this politically connected tiny company with no experience at all in Puerto Rico let alone experience on a project this big.  2 FTEs at the time they signed the contract. Lol. Apparently their business model is to use subcontractors for all their projects. It's the same concept as a city Service Manager repaving roads with a local construction company.Yea, I'm not criticizing that model. Lots of companies do it. But a 2 full time employee company winning a $300 million government contract is highly irregular.If the contract was so sweet and valuable why did only 2 firms accept the terms and submitted a proposal? Because it wasn't overseen by FEMA or the Army Corps of engineers who typically handle finding and vetting contractors.Please explain, as far as I read in the news there were two companies which said they would do the job, one was a local one the other the company in question and they won the competition due the fact they didn't ask for money in advance. I read that it was a no-bid contract.  They're charging $462/hr for subcontracted supervisor.  Is that a lot?  Is that a bargain?  Or is that in line with jobs such as these?  Personally, it sounds like a lot to me, but hey I don't know.  You never know until you open up the contract to bidders.  For them to be handing out such a large contract while putting in so little effort looking for bidders reeks of corruption.&gt; Whitefish is based in the hometown of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, who knows the firm’s chief executive and whose son once worked for Whitefish in a modest capacity. Whitefish Energy has two full-time employees, and its largest government contract prior to this was a $1.3 million job fixing 4.8 miles of power line. Its biggest government job other than that was replacing a pole. Whitefish Energy is a two-year-old firm, and it reported $1 million in revenue on its procurement documents. The firm plans to charge Uncle Stupid more than $300 an hour for a subcontracted lineman and $462 an hour for a subcontracted supervisor. (Subcontractors will make up the bulk of its work force, since — let’s repeat — the firm has two full-time employees.) The company will also charge about $400 per worker in per diem food and housing costs. A former Department of Energy official calls the arrangement “odd.” Now repeat what you said knowing Puerto Rico is defaulting on it's debts. It's a bankrupt island.Would an established company do the work knowing they most likely wouldn't get paid?They are being paid by U.S. government not Puerto Rico The contract was issued by PREPA, [Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority)&gt;The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) —Spanish: Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica (AEE)— is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power distribution, and power transmission on the island.[1] PREPA is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, making it a government monopoly. The authority is ruled by a board of directors appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Since 2014, PREPA is subject to the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, another government agency whose board of directors is also appointed by the governor.And just to give you an idea, earlier this year:&gt;Puerto Rico’s troubled power company defaulted on a deal to restructure roughly $9 billion in bond debt and sought court protection from its creditors, the government said on Sunday.[Puerto Rico’s Power Authority Effectively Files for Bankruptcy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/puerto-ricos-electric-power-authority-effectively-files-for-bankruptcy.html)They are being paid by U.S. government not Puerto Rico They are being paid by U.S. government not Puerto Rico They are being paid by U.S. government not Puerto Rico They were already working on the island from the previous storm!There are not a lot of companies who have the experience to deal with mountainous terrain, and apparently they also have to work on some lines by helicopter! That is $$$$$ type work.Is not, but the reason they won it was because they would take the job with no upfront payment, and little guarantee they would ever be paid in full, the other company declined that, and most won't do work with pr because they are billions and debt and have a poor reputation at paying back debt.Adding to that the company has already been in pr since the first storm working this whole time, so it's not like they are just two guys there trying to collect, they are doing their job.It was a federal contract. Puerto Rico isn't footing the bill.No, it's not. The contract is with PREPA. FEMA may at some point reimburse PREPA.Which means they bring no value in and of themselves.Yes it does.  They take care of arranging the work and fixing all the bullshit that comes up.Home builders are usually only a few people, they call up their subs and 30-200 people show up to build your house.  They do all the scheduling, rework if needed, make sure its done in a timely manner, etc.  And then they usually charge about 5-10% for that.I remodeled my house and did most of the contracting myself.  Honestly, paying a contractor his markup to call in his good crews and be done faster would have made my life a LOT easier.The difference is you don't already have mutual assistance agreements with other homeowners who already know how to do the work, and can be called on when needed.  Instead for some reason you hired two guys in Montana who just happen to have curious backgrounds, and paid them wayyy more money than you are paying for anything else.That is not that atypical for a general contractor.That's actually quite normal in construction. Work is either subcontracted or workers hired as needed. I work Survey and I know of maybe three full time employees that stay on between jobs. Someone needs to tell this lady that it's not all about her.According to Rubio if you “show up at the right time and place” you get a $330 million government contract. Does anyone else think this is pure bullsh$?t???We have got to stop this crap!!!You mean regular business. That's normal. You have the right contacts in any business and you can get lucrative work. That's how most businesses work in construction. How does fucking Marco Rubio know? Where's the RFP? Who was on the contract selection committee? Does the contract require some hires from within the PR community? Any comments from other respondents to the RFP?
Wait isn’t there a vacc... oh that right, the host of MTV’s Singled Out told everyone not to do it and they listened and didn't the doctor who's report she cited, redact the entire thing and had his medical license revoked?&gt;and didn't the doctor who's report she cited, redact the entire thing and had his medical license revoked?["Dr." Andrew Wakefield?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield?wprov=sfla1)  Yes, yes he did.There is good in this world.

I have found the soft ones the best burners. From that site:&gt;The disease has been confirmed in children and adults, both vaccinated **and unvaccinated**.Also, no mention of deaths or even hospitalizations. Just this line in most of the updates:&gt;None of the individuals required hospitalization and all are recovering.This doesn't seem to be a vaccination issue.&gt;The disease has been confirmed in children and adults, both vaccinated and unvaccinated.It 100% is a vaccine issue. People need to understand that vaccination does not provide 100% protection against mumps so they know to take further steps to avoid infection.That is true, but if everyone was vaccinated, it wouldn’t be a problem Without knowing the original source of the infection there is no way to know if an outbreak started with someone who had been vaccinated with greatly reduced/no immunity or with an unvaccinated person. While vaccinations are an enormously powerful and critical weapon against disease it is very important to be transparent and factual about their limitations to maintain both public health and to make credible, persuasive arguments for their use.The article literally says that people were were vaccinated got mumps as well as unvaccinated people. Maybe read the article?Vaccinations make you resistant, not immune. If you are vaccinated and everyone around you is not, the sheer number of germs will overwhelm your immune system. Conversely, if everyone is vaccinated, the germs are unable to gain a foothold and no one will get sick. It's like ants in an apartment building. If everyone's apartment is clean, you won't get ants. If your apartment is clean, but every other apartment is a mess, you'll get ants even though you cleaned.I am aware of how vaccines work...Clearly not by your response.....Obviously you don't understand how they work.I don't think you do either. If you did you'd realise that presence of an antigen is no guarantee a body can fight an infection.Uhh what?You proved my point.I think you are responding to the wrong personUp voted your obliterated comments not sure why you caught the down vote train by talking about what was in the article He’s being downvotes because saying the reason for this isn’t anti-vaxers who have caused this when if it wasn’t for them the disease would less likely have an outbreak this big since it would be difficult for it to infect so many people virus mutate. No reading, only regurgitating pop culture memes. You know how it is, Reddit wants that pharma advertisement cash, which is why the comments in these "stories" follows such a predictable pattern. Then again vaccines are quite profitable, Merck makes over 5 billion *net profit* per year from their sale and distribution.Jenny McCarthy's fake boobs gave me rotavirus.oh shut the fuck up with your conspiratard ideas... just vaccinate you idiot, or else preventable diseases will comback, unless you like having your kids in a wheel chair cuz of polio....There's also a small outbreak going on at Syracuse University right now.  &gt;Dear Students: Over the last several weeks, the team in the Office of Health Services has worked hard to limit the spread of mumps on our campus. Ongoing, regular communication to our campus community remains a critical component of these efforts. Though we continue to take a number of steps to limit your exposure to mumps, the illness continues to spread. At the strong recommendation of the Onondaga County Health Department, we are now offering you an additional vaccination, known as an MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) booster. That’s because the number of mumps cases among our undergraduate student population has exceeded five per 1,000 students.Does Syracuse not have a vaccination requirement? SUNY absolutely does. If I remember correctly even my backwoods-nowhere-university required a fully updated vaccine panel for freshmen.They do. The confirmed cases are in vaccinated students so far. There were 17 students unvaccinated when they sent out the first email iirc.Need a booster every ten years. Most of the kids prob didn't have boosters Hmm, I wonder...do I need a booster? Is this something I should worry about, or just leave it to my PCP?You can get a titer to find out. (That should autocorrected to tiger.... improbably should have left it at that)If there's an outbreak. I work at SU so I got a booster.To be fair Hawaii State University requires MMR too.Looks like a mumpy road ahead.What's interesting about this is ALL the cases confirmed so far are in students who WERE vaccinated. edited to source this, direct from the Syracuse University Healh website:http://health.syr.edu/health-tips/mumps-vaccinations.html&gt;I’ve been vaccinated; can I still get mumps? YES! Although vaccination is your best protection, it’s not 100 percent effective. In fact, every Syracuse student who has contracted mumps has been properly vaccinated.Citation needed, please.Not the previous poster, but the mumps vaccine is only 80% effective. 88% if you get two doses. It's pretty common that if mumps re-emerges, it can spread through the 10-20% of vaccinated people who are not immune. There have been several cases in recent years of small outbreaks on college campuses that were largely or entirely within already-vaccinated people.[citation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/06/mmr-vaccine-is-less-effective-for-mumps-than-measles-rubella%3fcontext=amp)[another citation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/03/14/amp/health-officials-considering-third-mmr-vaccine.aspx), this one about whether we should be recommending 3 mumps shots instead of just 2.[another citation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/07/185454), this one a preprint of an article in review now, discussed recent college outbreak  &amp; the "do we need a 3rd shot" issueThank you!Here you go - http://health.syr.edu/health-tips/mumps-vaccinations.html&gt;I’ve been vaccinated; can I still get mumps? YES! Although vaccination is your best protection, it’s not 100 percent effective. In fact, every Syracuse student who has contracted mumps has been properly vaccinated.Thank you!Yeah you need to get a booster every ten years. Most people don't .... and since you generally finish your MMR series at around 3 or 4.... all these kids were probably due for a booster and didn't get it Weirdly enough WWE currently has several wrestlers who are rumored to have mumps (or meningitis) There's meningitis in Hawaii, too. I knew at least two people who had it. One was a young adult, and she recovered. The other, a 7 year old boy, died of it. Clearly this is the vaccines faultAll those vaccinated people shedding on the poor kids with smart parents smh /slol. actually we're finding out a lot of us adults are no longer immune? i'm still confused by that. i keep meaning to get a titer done to check but haven't. but, the majority of the cases are on the north shore which is the haven for antivaxxers ....ughhhhhEdit: north shore of kauai. there's been 43 confirmed cases here so far...&gt; actually we're finding out a lot of us adults are no longer immune? i'm still confused by that.Eventually your body goes, "Huh, not seeing that illness coming around. Guess there's no point in having these anti-illness dudes on the payroll." The booster shots make your body think the illness is still around and still need an active defense.Yeah I for some reason had it in my head that it was a good for lifer. A lot of people did (do) and that's one of the reasons it's spreading the way it is but mostly because we have a crap ton of antivaxxers Also an unfortunate part to this is that the antivaxxers are clinging on to the fact that people who were vaccinated are still getting it.... making the problem worse and not realizing a lot of them just needed boosters At 35, I was screened for whether my childhood immunization for MMR was still good. It wasn’t, and I required a booster shot to work a 3 month contract in a hospital. Yeah I guess you have to get a booster every ten years? News to me. A friend of mine who is a PA at an urgent care didn't even know either, so I don't feel so badYou're putting your coworkers with autoimmune diseases at risk. You're worse than Jenny McCarthy at least she can claim stupidity, you can only claim ignorance, which is worse.So I guess that means he's Literally Hitler^^^TM because he didn't know he had to get booster shots?Can we maybe stop with the "anti-vaxxers are literally hitler" circlejerk? Like, I get it. Vaccines prevent diseases and don't cause autism. I get the point. Yeah. Can we stop bringing it up all the time?Roman Reigns did nothing wrongResurrecting evil voodoo priestesses always have unforeseen consequences. Sister Abigail in this case.Came here to write exactly this, good job!I got the mumps when I was a child because my vaccination failed. There was a record of me getting it but it never took I guess.It's the least effective if the MMR series.... about 80%Exactly and this is why herd immunity is so important and why when people don't get their kids vaccinated they are also putting other kids at riskMMR is an essential vaccine less because the diseases are fatal  and more because they're really, really contagious and you can still get them if you're vaccinated but have another ilness, IIRC.i literally just had a woman post that she was around during the time that measles, mumps, rubella ran rampant and that "they aren't that bad. just a little painful for a few weeks and not the end of the world." yeah, say that to the mother who loses a child from a preventable disease. Ehhh. It took me three rounds of chicken pox to build immunity. I got it, literally a handful of spots. My little sister got it, I got a dozen or so. My next sister got it and I was a scabby shell of a child, fortunately my immune system wised up after that one.There's a minimum number of pox you need to get in order to build immunity. If you dont get like 50-100, your body won't go into the full blown process of building antibodies against it. That's why people who had minor cases as kids often get it again as adults.Shit, I only got a few pox as a kid... But my mom got the pox while pregnant with me so who knows.TIL! I didn't know you needed to get a certain amount. That explains why my husband got it three times as a kid. I always wondered if he was just a rare case.Fun fact: Before there was any vaccine, parents used to host "chicken pox parties". One kid would come down with it, and they'd throw the party, so the kid could infect all the other kids. The idea was to get all the kids through it at the same time, close the schools, and reopen them later -- instead of having a lingering epidemic with absences that would continue for months. I never heard of this when I was a kid, so maybe it was just some NPR reporter going off half cocked about something that happened, but wasn't really all that common. IDK. Chicken pox partied were very much real. Same here.   I was 6 when I came down with it. I got it as a child because there *was* no vaccine yet. Lots of kids got it. We called it "the bumps". Also chickenpox. We called it "the chicken box". Also measles. We called it "the weasles". I was in the second grade when the first trials of the Salk vaccine for polio were being conducted. There was a bad batch of the vaccine, and several kids in my area (none that I knew) came down with full blown polio. I just learned about this recently, but it might explain why a hard bump developed under the injection site, and my arm was paralyzed at the elbow for a few weeks. Polio was the only childhood disease that we were afraid of, and we were *really* afraid of it, lemmetellya. [removed]There is absolutely nothing wrong with autism.A. He is joking. B. I mean, I would much rather not have Autism than have it.yeah, there is a lot wrong with autism lolI mean, I'd rather have autism than have Polio.That has literally nothing to do with what I am responding to.I donno.  A lot of these parents would rather their child die a painful death than be "autistic."&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong with autism.Yes there is. Its a mental disorder and kids who have it have to work a *lot* harder to be able to integrate with normal society. It's listed in the DSM as a mental disorder.Maybe you meant that we shouldn't be prejudice against autistic people, because that would make much more sense than what you posted.I’m not PMing you Atari games after that comment. Balthazar is a thirsty bitch. I had mumps when I was young because for some reason I never got that vaccine. It was awful.Some asshole tourist is gonna come back to the contiguous states with it i'm surethis is probably true. i'm sorry. the state is trying really hard to prevent the spread. if a student contracts it they can't attend school for like 3 weeks? and any student in the class who is unvaccinated has to stay out as well. but they are missing the siblings aspect to this whole train of thinking...and the fact they share playgrounds. but at least they are doing somethingThese are CONFIRMED cases. Have a friend who is a doc and she said a lot of times a patient won't get tested to confirm because if they get tested ... whether positive or not.,. They can't go to work for nine days. Obviously if they get tested positive they are out for longer. So based on that alone there's prob s lot more casesEdit: missing a word How many of those mumps cases had autism? Compared to the general population?So it wasn’t just the WWE...So it's not just Conservatives who are anti-vaxxers?Idiocy is bipartisan.Not sure if you're being sarcastic, but liberals can be just as anti-science as anyone else. See: GMOs, gluten, healing crystals, nuclear energy, and most definitely vaccines. Liberal communities are some of the least vaccinated. Agreed. I am a liberal myself, but the new-agey anti-science movement coming from the left really fucking annoys me.hmm id say its not really new, look at the hippies of the 70s using crystals and all that weird shit too. its been around on both sides forever. Yes, but things like anti-vaxx and anti-GMO (as well as the others listed) have grown greatly since the interned age. The internet is a double edged sword of information and misinformation. This is in fact an explicitly liberal affliction, unfortunately. That's not to say conservatives aren't anti-vaxxers, it's just far more interesting that it's often higher educated liberals.Wow - actually the rates of anti-vaxxers is about the same politically, the reasons are what differ. It is not even remotely a "left" side issue.There assorted groups of religious right loons against vaccinations for various fundie type reasons too.Some recent outbreaks have correlated closely with where their congregations reside.Right, what I meant to say is crazies being crazy isn't that shocking, but well educated left leaning communities being afflicted might be. It's interesting to me, at least.
No, the files were already set to be released. He simply did not exercise his option as president to stop the release.Except he did. He released around 3,000 and blocked the rest. This way he gets credit for sticking to his word when in reality he didn't. Don't buy the distraction.You are correct. I read a couple more articles after I commented , and I was uninformed prior. He blocked the rest for at least 180 days when they may be released with some redactions, which was allegedly at the behest of the FBI and CIA.That would mean the rest of the files, possibly redacted, will at earliest be released April 26th, 2018 (which just happens to be my birthday).  Should be a good birthday [redacted].Ironic since his supporters constantly would make that joke only to see Trump become another puppet of the deep state.Not really.The authorization came from a 1992 law and Trump withheld a large number of documents that were supposed to be released.In a sense, he failed to fulfill the law hiding behind some bogus national security label.The 1992 ruling clearly states that it is subject to presidential approval. I'm no fan of Trump but in no sense did he fail to fulfill the law.Read the act. The law clearly states Trump had to certify that disclose of the documents would cause ham outweighs the public interest to prevent the release. Trump can't determine that because a review has not been made. He claims there's confusion with the agencies' opinions. There's nothing in the law that requires Trump to approve anything. TBF you don't know if it's bogus or not. 😜The WH admitted they can't determined it therefore they are initiating a 6 month review to see if it is or not. Not that we should be surprised with the Trump WH being incompetent. How can we read them? Where are they being released through?You can read them on the National Archives website. Expect it to be slow, if it loads at all.https://www.archives.gov/research/jfkCheck the 4chan message boards; those guys have super reliable conspiracy intel.Just joking, that's a terrible place for good infoOne word: GeorgesorosOne more word: GeorgecostanzaI can't wait to see what this shows, there has to be a reason why the 30,000 files that were realeased were kept secret for so long. Trump only allow the release of 3,000 of them and blocked the rest.Experts are saying there's no bombshell in those documents.I used to be a reporter, and once wrote about a just-released FBI report on suspected communist activities on a college campus. I think people are vastly misunderstanding these documents. For every interesting sentence, there are dozens of pages of just clerical kind of background stuff, reams of records about investigator movements, etc, and just general piles of really, really boring bureaucratic meanderings. If there's something relevent, I'd be amazed if it hadn't been fleshed out elsewhere decades ago.A reason, sure, but not necessarily an interesting reason. Like, pages of testimony can reveal all sorts of stuff like where the witness was and when that could be embarrassing. Or classified, like Secret Service tactics, etc. That would justify its previous secrecy, while adding nothing of note to the JFK assassination.Regardless, still adds more to the story. And Secret Service tactics might point out a fuck up that led to JFK's death... an intentional fuck up? I better get my tinfoil hat polished. Most likely the stuff has to do with Intel analysis after the fact involving various other countries.If it's exciting, people wouldn't just be screaming "BUT TRUMP DIDNDT DODDOO IT" as the top comment on every fucking thread, they'd be talking about the content.I'm wrong!so he traveled back to 1992 and got congress to write the law that released them?Still wrong!no they haven't, the law said it was to be released 25 years after it was written. It was written 25 years ago. SO now was the time it was always supposed to be released. No other president even had any reason to block them, and its funny that you think that they did. The only thing Trump has done so far is allowed some of the documents to be released later. Which he was entitled to do by law.Thank you, that was a nice way to have me examine my beliefs and correct my misinformation. I appreciate it, truly :)In this day an age I am happy that anyone is willing to admit that they had misinformation. Thanks for the positive reply :)The only way out of this propaganda and misinformation hell is honesty, and hearing what other people are trying to say to you.  Any little bit of positivity and truth spreads like a purifying meme, in my imagination :)How about them MLK and Malcolm X files next?Donald, Keep my name out of your mouth. You're a joke. - JFKOh fuck off.
[removed][removed]Just curious...I get the creep (it was a joke, btw) but, why developmentally stunted?I appreciate that you're looking for feedback and while I'm not the person that insulted you, I'd like to take a crack at it anyway.Right now Reddit (and a lot of American society) is touchy about sex abuse. Even if she is a sexually mature teen and will suffer no lasting negative effects from this, people are sick to death of hearing yet another person we trusted to not be a fuck up is fucking up again. A lot of people feel like it's not the time for jokes and malepatternbadness probably feels you're lacking something to not pick up on that.in case you're wondering: "Florida's age of consent is 18, though the law contains a provision allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to consent to having sex with someone age 16 to 23. To qualify for removal under "Romeo and Juliet," the victim must have been at least 14 years old and the offender no more than four years older." -sourced from Google.comWell she was 15 and he was 36, so not sure why this is relevant. It's relevant because the deputies actions are in violation of all of Florida's terms of consent, and are clearly a criminal actions.In other states his actions would not be criminal actions, but in Florida they are.I see I thought it was illegal in most of the states except maybe Hawaii.
&gt; Both suspects were charged as adults with, among other things, attempted murder, making terrorist threats, and intent to commit arson.Attempted murder? There must be more to the story.Nonviolent arson? Spontaneous combustion?Level 3 fire wizard? Pretty sure I saw the one on the right in Shadow of War.Back 2013 I sent an email to my counselor saying I felt like I could kill someone. They accused me of terroristic threat and jailed me. Small county, rich, white, one criminal judge one criminal prosecutor and I was sentenced to 16 months in a state jail facility in East Texas called Bradshaw. Where I spent the worst times of my life. I meant only to express my anger about some life issues, it's alot different when people have physical plans or weapons though.I don't understand what made it terrorism but makes other cases not terrorism...there's a shit load missing here.The moment a bomb is involved it's terrorism.That's dumb. It doesn't fit the definition for terrorism just because there's a bomb.They both look like they would have to "plot" to get out of bed and take a dump.
We need another insult from Trump to help settle things down. Does no one think of what damage this does to the atmosphere?Yes, [that's why in 1963 most of the world agreed to not do it anymore.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty) Hahaha, Environment. That's just the thing which keeps us alive, why would anyone care about it?Yes, and there’s already been over 500 atmospheric tests. And over twice as much tested underground. Can't the us just test one over Pyongyang already?nope that would provoke china and russia to test some over the usWhy? China would probably be annoyed but they don't like the norks, and Russia isn't interested in dying in a nuclear war.Well China has mentioned if the US attacks first they will respond, if NK attacks first, they will stay neutral.Yeah, but they won't - they win nothing and the US is their biggest market.they have already stated unless north korea attacks first they wont allow a us attack. plus this would be to close to their border fallout could hit themWould China and Russia *really* nuke USA over NK?China probably would. For the same reasons we would if they did it over Vancouver bc. Theirs one big difference though. Canada is in NATO.US is treaty bound to protect Canada and retaliate to nuclear attack.China and NK are not treaty bound in the same way. I doubt China will back NK in nuclear attack. At worst it will call an emergency UN security council meeting and condemn US actions. (Gotta put on a good show for domestic audiences in China)excuse me, they have a [mutual defense treaty](https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/china_dprk.htm). Please stop with the 'China would-' assumptions, especially in support of military action. MacArthur thought the Chinese wouldn't intervene, right until the moment they were run over by hundreds and thousands of Chinese troops in the Korean war. Assume they would intervene in any conflict in the Korean peninsula.I like your train of thought. I agree.i thought they expired after 30 turns.they have already stated unless north korea attacks first they wont allow a us attack. plus this would be to close to their border fallout could hit themBecause, flawed as the US is, we aren't entirely cold blooded and know that there are lots of people there whose only crime was being subjected to systematic brainwashing by their government. Some sanity. A war with NK would probably be entirely conventional from the American side.Why do that when a massive carpet bombing campaign would be more destructive and pose no immediate risk to China and South Korea?lets just shoot one over NK airspace from the Yellow Sea. It would be exactly what they have been doing to Japan.China Nukes SK or Japan in return, Russia teams up with China and world war 3 starts. Not a good idea.They are only doing this because their underground testing facility nearly collapsed the mountain containing it. The rest of the world realized what a terrible idea atmospheric nuke testing was over 50 years ago. 
That there should not be legal in any way shape or form.Anyone can sue for anything. But it doesnt mean they will win, and it will be easy to get it dismissed, leaving the frivolius woman legal fees and nothing good.The article says &gt; To make matters worse, the deputy said the blocks were stolen within a county that was subject to a **state of emergency declared by the governor under chapter 252**.I googled but didn't find anything that would make matters worse for this woman.Not sure about Florida but I found this about Texas.Some states, including Texas, have laws making the penalties much harsher for looting during a crisis such as a natural disaster. For instance, in Texas, the maximum penalty for burglary may only be 15 years, but if it occurred during an official state of emergency, the maximum sentence is life in prison.thank you. was wondering the same thing...&gt;The homeowner told detectives that he caught her taking the blocks without permission. They were part of a remodeling project and were stored in the front yard, __about 4 feet from the roadway__, the owner said.&gt;Upright said she thought they were trash. Deputies said she then threatened to sue the owner because she hurt her back on his property while loading the blocks into her vehicle.In case some here don't know, putting free stuff out near the road for other people to take is actually a common practice in many parts of the country.That being said, regardless of whether that was the case, injuring yourself while moving heavy objects is an inherent risk to moving heavy objects, and she has no standing to sue him over that.  &gt; and she has no standing to sue him over that.You say that but crazier suits have happened.Happened, not won. All those crazy suits you hear about are almost allways twisted from a legit case.But still happened, which means it's not unlikely that she could sue.I dont think you quite understand what that means. She 100% could definatly sue. She has a constitutional right to sue. But suing someone is like writting a letter. Being able to do it doesnt mean anyone has to actually care what you say. She can sue, but she will lose before it even gets to a hearing, and she will be out the legal fees for no gain. And the homeowner will be out their legal fees as well.Their liability insurance should pick up the tab for the legal defense. Well they could represent themselves and still easily win for no cost, or they coild countersue for the legal fees and have her pay them. The second is a little harder but its pretty obviois that the lawsuit is both frivolous and meant as a threat to punish the homeowner for catching her stealing, so i would say they have a good shot. Civil law is not my area though, so the exact chances of success om the second is hard to estimate exactly.&gt;Well they could represent themselves and still easily win for no costThere would be a cost, just that it wouldn't be direct to lawyers.  They would still have expenses in getting to court and missing work to be at court.   Their time is worth something.&gt;or they could counter sue for the legal fees and have her pay them.I'm no lawyer but from what I understand this can be difficult and if you are unsuccessful then you have even more legal fees to deal with.--What should happen is lawyers who are vulturous enough to take a case like hers should be penalized with splitting with the person who brings the frivolous suit payment to the opposing parties to cover their legal fees plus compensating them for their time and any loss of work.So you are correct about the first part, i should have mentioned that, and that is my fault for ignoring that.The second part is partially cirrect, in that it is tough to win, but it doesnt cost anything extra. You can file the paperwork at the same time you present your initial motion to dismiss the case. And while it is hard to win legal fees, this is precisely the type of case that it is designed for, so they have a good shot.&gt; but it doesnt cost anything extraSo lawyers don't charge any extra for their extra time?Why did you quote him, leave out half his quote, then explain what he said in detail. That's fucking weird to me, even for the internet.Many states (and federal courts) have statutes or rules that allow for fees and costs to be awarded to the defendant when a case is frivolous or without basis in fact. 
The fact that he is an illegal alien shouldn't have anything to do with Zarate's crime... The fact that he's illegally in the country and in San Francisco to effect a such a heinous crime is on San Francisco, their Mayor and their police department.  This murder would not have taken place had San Francisco not given this man sanctuary effectively protected him from deportation… again.That's not actually true though. The issue is that SF had charges against the guy for marijuana possession or something stupid. He was in Federal custody, and was sent back to SF to face those charges. He didn't just happen to be in SF because of their sanctuary city status. The murder would not have taken place had the city not had dumb-ass charges against him that resulted in him being brought back to SF.Did they not know what they were about to see?The defense kept saying it was an accidental shooting and a richochet. The Jury just saw that it was cold blooded murder.Ah. That makes sense. I could link a /r/watchpeopldie video and you'd "know" what you're about to see and probably still gasp when you saw it. Like the recent one with the woman that hit the sign.  Good point, I should have thought my comment through a bit more.Thanks!All comments in this thread are hidden.  Reddit is the worst.  The agenda is quite clear.I'm confused.  What's the agenda?One must never show illegal immigration or sanctuary policies in a negative light.Aah ok.  Personally, I think I hear them painted in both a positive and negative light almost daily, if not multiple times daily.  I'd just prefer if people could work harder to remain objective instead of pushing a slant, but that seems like a tall order lately.Not just a guy but a “homeless immigrant”. Key words Fox News would like you to know. Don't look now but, CBS wants you to know that too!https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-francisco-pier-murder-trial-kate-steinle-tourists-photos-jose-ines-garcia-zarate/&gt;Garcia Zarate was homeless when he shot Steinle. He had recently completed a prison sentence for illegal re-entry to the U.S. when he was transferred to the San Francisco County jail to face a 20-year-old marijuana charge.&gt;Prosecutors dropped that charge, and the San Francisco sheriff released Garcia Zarate from jail despite a federal immigration request to detain him for at least two more days for deportation.This story did initially cause a shitstorm of a debate on sanctuary city policy, crackdowns on those who illegally re-enter the country multiple times, and other immigration matters.So yes: mentioning the immigration status of the shooter is proper journalism.Not doing so would be like doing a retrospective on the Trayvon Martin shooting timeline and not once even mentioning the races of Martin and Zimmerman.Bad Example, IMO. The race of Martin and Zimmerman is completely irrelevant.Neither were white."But he could have been my son....." ObamaThat triggers you trumpsters, doesn’t it.The Travon Martin case made national news because of race.  Do you not remember the coverage?You examples were specifically about race, this is not. The status of the person is irrelevant to this case. This case made national news because of the perpetrator's multiple illegal entries into the US, him being out and free while his case was pending, and San Francisco and other cities' sanctuary city polices.*This* was the context for which this story became national news.To not mention to perpetrator's status is to ignore the context in which this story broke and became newsworthy across the country.He was set free because of SF's sanctuary city policies.  If he had been turned over to ICE as requested then Kate Steinle wouldn't have been murdered.  So his status is relevant to the story whether you like it or not.ICE should issue actual warrants and not just IOUs then the city would hold them I guess we should just hold people indefinitely , forget the 4a and call it a day.4th ammendment?  He is clearly and obviously in the country illegally and has been convicted of that same felony multiple times.  He has been convicted of felony re-entry before and he has plead guilty to it before.  His presence in the country meets the standard for probable cause for yet another felony re-entry charge.Doesn't matter what they did or admitted to, Still need a warrant to hold them, constitution is quite clear on that. ICE is hoping the local agencies give them cover, in reality you should be blaming them for not following up on their requests in a timely manner. Maybe, but this is about the murder trial, not a deportation hearing, the open question is if it was an accident. His race or immigration status has no bearing on the facts of the case, **if the discharge of the gun was accidental, then there was no crime , undocumented or otherwise**. And all that hullabaloo was completely besides the point .The prosecutors are not alleging he stole the gun that was used in this incident, they are not accusing him of stealing it from a park service ranger, they are not disputing that the shot was a ricochet.They are alleging he pulled the trigger of the gun he found wrapped in a shirt  on the pier intentionally.The only relevant part of the case is that last question. Was it accidental discharge or murder.The jury isn't hearing evidence on his immigration status wtf are you whining about? Really going to defend a murderer here? Really? Gtfo&gt;Really going to defend a murderer here?If it is proven to be an accidental is he still a murderer?If it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was intentional would you give him that benefit and trust his innocence?I bet the answer to that depends on how you feel about undocumented immigrants.. **I am defending our due process, given to all people regardless of what they did or who they are**If you forget that you should be too ashamed to call yourself American. This particular case makes it important to mention that fact.I guess they should not report on facts then.I guess not 😔You disagree with the description? I'm just curious how you would feel if that was your daughter? Do you even hear yourself?Do you think that feeling would be different if a citizen did it?Why are you acting line only people here without authorization kill people?As a demographic , people committing the civil misdemeanor of unauthorized presence, have less criminal activity.Civil misdemeanor? Re-entry is a crime. He committed a felony after his re-entry five *separate* times. &gt; After an alien has been legally "removed" from the United States, **federal criminal law makes it a felony for that alien to reenter** (or be found in) the country without approval of the government.http://immigration.findlaw.com/deportation-removal/illegal-reentry-into-the-u-s-after-removal-crime-and-punishment.htmlI do think that if my child was killed by someone who kept coming back into the country illegally it would prompt me to consider the implications of sanctuary policies.  I hear myself.Why is this line of thinking considered racist?  What if this guy shot a legal immigrant who did all the work to come here for a better life and then some asshole person here illegally shot them to death?  You don't think that family would have some negative feelings towards illegal aliens?This guy committed felony reentry so your entire argument is invalidIf I knew that this particular occurrence could of been avoided, and was a result of lack of enforcement, I would want to do something about it. I wouldn't want to create sanctuary cities! I would support every measure to stop illegal immigration. So yeah, I do hear myself. Think of the children!A killing, you say? By a *mexican illegal immigrant*, no less? Better build a wall and ship out every brown person in the country! /sNo one is seriously suggesting that. But thank you for extrapolating.&gt; No one is seriously suggesting that.Wait, weren't building The Wall and kicking out "the bad hombres" major cornerstones of the Trump campaign? Aren't his supporters still raging about those issues today? There indeed are people who seriously believe a multibillion dollar wall and mass deportations is a measured response to a murder.Incarcerating and deporting criminals is not the same or even close to "kick every brown person out of the country," so fuck off with that.Just because people want to build a Wall does not mean that we should refrain from reporting illegal immigrants who murdered American citizens simply because their feelings might get hurt. Granted, there are plenty of cases where one’s illegal status is unnecessarily reported, but considering this kurzer happened in a sanctuary city and the assailant in question was released from custody despite being recommended for deportation, I’d say it’s within reason to bring it up.&gt; Just because people want to build a Wall does not mean that we should refrain from reporting illegal immigrants who murdered American citizensWho ever said that, besides you just now?You’re the one who brought up the Wall. I was simply responding in kind.That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's like you're intentionally responding with gibberish in order to confuse me, or "gas lighting" as it's formally known. Huh.If you insist.You were arguing that someone believes "we should refrain from reporting illegal immigrants who murdered American citizens simply because their feelings might get hurt." Who believes that? What you did was invent an argument to argue against, also known as a straw man argument. I'm trying to help you out here, buddy. But you probably know all of this, because it's part of a toolbox that need to employ on a regular basis to even exist on the internet.The wall part, and every undocumented worker part is true though. No matter how badly it would bankrupt us, how unfeasibly stupid it is, and how poorly disguised the xenophobia is.The Wall is stupid, punishing illegals who murder our citizens is not.Nobody thinks undocumented immigrants shouldn't be punished for breaking the law, reformist when it comes to murder. The fact that undocumented immigrants are, on average, more law abiding than police officers never enters into the equation for the blind nationalists who want to punish the rest of them for merely existing. Well we can apply that logic to all the illegals who aren’t going around killing American citizens or committing other crimes.That's a poor excuse. You're one of those people who would argue "but citizens kill people to"Yes, they do.So what you're mad about is... someone out there apparently wants to not punish this guy for murder? Who? Who are these people that you're so angry about? You and/or Fox News have subtly invented this argument... that an unidentified body of "liberals" out there, somewhere, don't want this guy to see justice for murder. Show me these people, /u/DrScientist812. Who exactly are these people that want to see this man forgiven for murder because he's an immigrant?Why do you let your world view be shaped by Fox News in the first goddamn place? You should know better by now, ffs.Look up the recent SacBee article. They pretty much take all blame off this guy and put it on the ranger who's gun was stolen.
Have to admit, I didn’t realize he was still alive. I thought he died during Katrina.IIRC, his house was destroyedNot destroyed, just damaged.  There's a picture of it after the storm on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fats_Domino#Domino_and_Hurricane_Katrina) page.Interesting fact is that ~~Vince Young~~ JaMarcus Russell helped in evacuating Fats right after the storm (he was dating Fats' granddaughter I think).Jamarcus russel according to Wikipedia That happened in the Bernstein universeThere is no Bernstein universe. There's a Berenstein universe and a Berenstain universeOh shit, you don't know about the Bernstein universe!? Buckle up,  buddy.Is it the universe where Bernie won?I think it's a universe of bear people. Jan Mayen will rise again With steins full of beer! It's run by a family of lawyers, one of whom is blind. Bernsteins;gateSomebody just wrote RIP on the exterior wall of his house http://ScreenshotBot.com/?img=B5XDThats the oneNo, there was a rescue that got into the news, with a picture of him being helped into a helicopter. EDIT:  Correction, the photo was of him being helped out of a boat, [seen here.](http://media.nola.com/tpphotos/photo/2012/05/11105826-standard.jpg)His house was destroyed but him and his 6 classic Rolls Royces were fine.I thought he died in the Buddy Holly crash.You're probably thinking of J.P. Richardson aka "The Big Bopper"His house was destroyed but then he moved in with Jamarcuss Russell.I remember reading an article that specifically confirmed his rescue.r/MandelaEffectAint that a Shame. RIP. His music influenced rock and roll. Without him, Chuck Berry, and many others, there WOULD be no Rock and Roll. I kinda got a little chill when I read your opening line and heard it in Fats’ voice with the background piano rolling. RIP"Ain't That a Shame" was one of the first songs I learned to play on the guitar. That's when I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill. RIP.Well that’s a bit gay tbh[deleted]Wow you’re a sookOtis and Fats gets your chemicals going ey? You’ve got a black thing for sure I've seen him live. Gawd I'm getting old. I remember the day Elvis died, and the day John Lennon was shot. My tears fell like rain. My first cassette was a Fats Domino greatest hits.  Greatness.Not just new orleans legend, but rock and roll godfather.He made a fortune when he revolutionized the home pizza delivery industry.lol i had to read this at least 10 times before i got it. have a [reddit silver](http://i.imgur.com/2Dyrzet.png)Damn, RIP.Elvis once said he was the real king of rock and rollApparently the only person to sell more records than Fats was Elvis.Elvis refused to answer to ‘The King’, deferring to Domino. Literally met his daughter on the carnival sunshine karaoke on Sunday and we told her it was a shame her dad died and she corrected us and said he wasn’t... and now he’s actually dead :/RIP Fats Domino, you’ll be missed!you murderer. He just HAD to be right!I guess in your case, continue to be missed You missed a HUGE opportunity.See, when a situation like this comes up, you say, *"Oh shit, I must have gone back too far"* before quickly glancing at your phone or watch. When she asks you to clarify, just change the subject. Act like you shouldn't have mentioned it. Whatever. Just make a hasty retreat.By now, she'd be thinking back wondering if she met a time traveler. Or like the other guy said, a murderer. Yea but couldn't you say that to literally anyoneI figure you could get away with saying it to the majority of people you've never met before and expect never to meet again. You're bound to hit pay dirt on a few of them eventually. Though we're apartYou're part of me stillFor you were my thrillOn Blueberry Hill first rock and roll song i heard.Me too.Happy Days?no, we had a hotrodder neighbor who'd roar past in a cloud of dust with his radio blaring. this was in the mid-fifties.That was about ten tears befor my time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fats_Domino&gt; The Domino family was of French Creole background. Louisiana Creole French was his first language.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Creole&gt; Louisiana Creole (kréyol la lwizyàn; French: créole louisianais) is a French-based creole language spoken by far fewer than 10,000 people, mostly in the state of Louisiana.[3] Due to the rapidly shrinking number of speakers, Louisiana Creole is considered an endangered language.[4]RIPHave to applaud a dude nicknamed “Fats” making it to 89.According to one of his songs, "they call me the Fat Man cause I weigh 200 pounds." That used to be fat. Sideshows used to have "world's fattest man" types that were like 300 pounds.If he was like 5'6" though 200 lbs is pretty fatRIP Fats.  You will be missed.  Oh no, not The Fats. That leaves only Little Richard from the original few.Jerry Lee LewisHe was a bit of a Johnny come lately, first record in 58. Chuck and Fats were 55. Surprisingly to me, Elvis first rock and roll record was 1954:*As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "That's All Right". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.*[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#1953.E2.80.931955:_First_recordings)Jerry Lee's first record was in '56, but he supposedly recorded a demo in 1954 in MS or LA, too.  Elvis had his first big hits in '56, while Jerry Lee had his in '57.  In all the histories and criticism I've read, "The Killer" has always been considered one of the original Rock and Roll artists - *not* a "Johnny come lately".EDIT: I'd add Don Everly to Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis as the last **three** great original rock and rollers still living.&gt; Don EverlyC'mon now, I'll give you Jerry Lee, but the Everly Brothers are barely rock and roll. What next? Fabian and Pat Boone?Sounds like you need to take a course in Rock and Roll History.&gt;The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. They were in the first group inducted into thd Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I don't recall *anyone* then saying they didn't belong - not critics, nor musicians.  The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel and *anybody* who sang Rock and Roll harmonies always considered the Everlys to be huge influences.  Here are some quotes from their Wikipedia entry...&gt;The music of the Everly Brothers influenced the Beatles, who referred to themselves as "the English Everly Brothers"[36] when Paul McCartney and John Lennon went hitchhiking south to win a talent competition.[48] They based the vocal arrangement of "Please Please Me" on "Cathy's Clown."[49]&gt;Keith Richards called Don Everly "one of the finest rhythm players."[50]&gt;Paul Simon, who worked with the pair on "Graceland," said on the day after Phil's death, "Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard. Both voices pristine and soulful. The Everlys were there at the crossroads of country and R&amp;B. They witnessed and were part of the birth of rock and roll.Comparing the Everlys to Fabian is nuts.  Just nuts. They had some rock and roll influenced pop songs, yes, and they were very influential with pop, yes, but they weren't founding fathers of rock and roll the way the others were. I wouldn't put Sam Cooke in that list either.Though of course add Buddy Holly.&gt;...weren't founding fathers of rock and roll the way the others were. I'm sure those "others" would disagree.  *You* might not think their music is authentic enough "rock and roll", but what you (or I) think of it isn't important.  What's important is whether the next generation of rock and rollers considered the Everlys to be authentic.  And the record clearly shows that they *were* considered to be authentic by that next generation.  &gt;I wouldn't put Sam Cooke in that list either.Rod Stewart would probably kick your ass for saying that.  Or try to.  Rod's old.&gt;Though of course add Buddy Holly.He was already on that list - you must have missed him.Well, they wrote [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFE2SnliiV0).Covered by Roy Orbison, Nazareth, Joan Jett, Keith Richards/Norah Jones, Kim Deal/Robert Pollard...NB the Everlys wrote their own music, unlike Mr. Presley.I thought Roy wrote that! Anyway, lovely pop song, but not rock and roll.Edit: Actually no, [Wikipedia says it was written by Boudleaux Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Hurts) but first recorded by the Everly Bros.Edit: Also wrote two other Every Brothers hits: "All I Have to Do Is Dream" and "Bye Bye Love". I think we can safely remove the Every Brothers from the list of rock and roll founders.Let's keep reading Wikipedia:&gt;The Everly Brothers were an American country-influenced **rock and roll duo**, known for steel-string acoustic guitar playing and close harmony singing&gt;Paul Simon, who worked with the pair on "Graceland," said on the day after Phil's death, "Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard. Both voices pristine and soulful. The Everlys were there at the crossroads of country and R&amp;B. **They witnessed and were part of the birth of rock and roll.**Arguably, once Elvis went into the Army, he sort of stopped being the Rock 'n' Roller he originally was. Even "rock" songs like "Burnin' Love" pale in comparison to the raw Elvis from the early to mid 50s.I believe Fats recorded "The Fat Man" in '49.We still have Dion. The guy has been putting out some pretty good stuff lately too.[deleted]Wow, this is real. Mind is blown.The parent comment was deleted, but I'm assuming it was Putin's rendition of Blueberry Hill.Yeah, that guy should do something with that talent :)YooooooWhat the fuckLed Zeppelin performing [Blueberry Hill] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZXoLR7oP4)He had a good run, and made the world a better place with his music.Here is a clip of Vladimir Putin singing Blueberry Hill for a charity eventhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV4IjHz2yIoThat’s the most surreal thing I’ve ever seen.Very strange. Surprisingly decent singer.da!  I mean, uh, er... yes, he has better voice than Sinatra!Is Blueberry Hill where they take the journalists critical of him?Blueberry Hell.....Those celebrities sucking up to him hurts to watch. You can hate the man and still be blown away by this. I mean, it's amusing listening to a guy with a guy awkwardly singing in his non-native tongue, but blown away? eh.Eh, it's not mind blowing because his singing is somehow incredible, it's mind blowing because of who he is, just unexpected..Fats' music speaks for itself. Loved the man. He used to perform any song the crowd shouted out from his entire catalogue, in any order the crowd wanted. So awesome. [Van Morrison's 'Domino' is his homage to Fats. Van loved Fats and Fats' music influenced Morrison's heavily. ](https://youtu.be/QOsGA4_Y89c) Rest in Peace, legend. You will be missed. Lots of ad/bloat at this link. I'd try another source. I've never understood why so many r/news links are from weird news sources I've never heard of.Spam sites paying to get on Reddit to increase their views.Fake news. But I saw this on Twitter, so at least it's confirmed. Great...who else do we have now that we can call Fats?ur mumu/P1um5mu99ler got *JAKED* Would you accept Chubby Checker?Or his older brother, Obese Mah Jong.Come on, let'sHe was alive??We should drape all of Bourbon St in black.

It's in the Beatles' discography, but it sure doesn't sound like a Beatles song.The Beatles did this first. oh wow, i never heard this! My grandfather always told a story of his college days when he stood on his piano and danced while fats domino played"Ain't That Ashame?"May he R.I.P."I'm Gonna Be a Wheel Someday" is one of my favourite songs; I used to listen to it on repeat for days. It made me feel upbeat and positive. 89 years was a long life. Tickle those ivories in the great beyond, Fats. RIP.Elvis is dead.  So is Gene Vincent, Bobbie Fuller, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Johnnie Cash, and Chuck Berry.  Only Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis are left.  Jerry Lee is wicked and can't be kilt, so that really only leaves Little Richard.  We need to give Little Richard some sort of prize.Tom Petty, Gord Downie and now Fats. The 'celebrities die in threes' went after music this time.Walter Becker tooNever heard of Gord Downie.  Chuck Berry died this year tooGord Downie was the frontman for the legendary Canadian band The Tragically Hip. I emplore you to listen.I regret not listening sooner, now I have a large catalogue to go through which is a blessing.It's not very often I'd suggest starting with a "Best Of" album, but "Yer Favorites" is like 30 flawless songs back to backI did, Wheat Kings is a godly good song. I'm from WA state about 75 miles from the border. I played ice hockey as a youth and for about 6 years I spent every other weekend for 6 months in BC or Alberta playing hockey and spent summers at a camp in BC. I absolutely adore Canada and her residents and this band is making me wistful for the winters and summers of my youth. I really need to quit being lazy and get my ass back up to Penticton and Kelowna, absolutely perfect country. I feel like I'm betraying my country, but I just can't bring myself to like them. They're great if you like that word-heavy, tinny-voice crap from the 90's.  Which many people do, and that's fine.  Just not my cup of tea.Charles Bradley as well. Sure if you only want to pick three that have died this year.Well ya....the saying is celebrities die in 3s....they mean within a short time. It's not 'well Fats, John Lennon and Elvis died, that's three.'Charles Bradley died like a week ago. I guess Ida Jane didn't come back today. RIP Fatsputin's favorite artistJust bought a vinyl album of Fats recently... Good stuff... Will be missed.RIP Fats, loved your art! There goes my heart again.There goes my heart again.He was a real leader in the "Wow, that guy is still alive?!" category. Sad to see him go.One of my students asked me who Fats Domino was this morning, completely at random....i think she did itPutin paying his respects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNbyjVmbjVgMy favorite track of his was [I Want To Walk You Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqq363lxcWk).  It is just a simple shuffle that is gentle and carried by Fats vocal, which is amiable and assured like all of his melodies.  Fats made making hits look real easy.  His piano playing is serviceable but unspectacular.  His melody is obvious; his lyric very simple and unadorned.  Why then do we fall for his rudimentary stage mannerisms and dance hall syllogisms?  It is his genial manner and the gleam in his eye that pulls everyone in.  You don't ever imagine Fats Domino being anything but even keeled and cool.  In a world that saw a bunch of small time dance bands start a nascent record business that became a brutal industry almost immediately and stayed that way, he couldn't have been a more amiable and friendly person unless he was practically Roy Orbison.  It says something that he lived his whole life in his neighborhood and his neighbors had real affection for the man.  Everyone liked him.  How many people can you say that about?Damn, RIP Fats you legendI thought he died 20-30 years ago.I thought he was Mr Bison from Street Fighter IIRest in peace, musical hero.Lots of folks did not know he was still with us, let alone appreciate his art and his influence.  Great run, Fats Domino!  Hope you find your thrill on the other side of the hill.....Be kind rewind fans will understandAin't that a shame, my tears are falling like rain.Sad. He was an excellent singer and Valley of Tears is still in regular rotation. To call this the end of an era is an understatement. RIP Fats, and thanks for the music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6JZW7zMDfYWhen I see him I think of Oliver “Who Shot the LaLa” Morgan. Another Domino fallenI wonder how he felt about rock music in the decades after his death.  The Beatles, the Stones, Pink Floyd, the Sex Pistols, the Pretenders, Motley Crue, R.E.M., Nirvana, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, the Foo Fighters (um... Nickelback), Avenged Sevenfold... To have been at the vanguard of a musical genre and to have seen it change so, so, so much.The man was indeed a Wheel.  RIP.  Dare you not to get happy when listening to his music.Is that the guy from the movie "be kind rewind"I always liked papa johns betterWhat's New Orleans?New Orleans resident here.

Its like atlantis with drunk mermaids and bad streets.Anyone else think it was a little, uh, weird that Fatz Geronimo was a gorilla?
Not really newsworthy in the Bay Area unless there's damage.or if it was higher like 8-9.0 and off the coast.Yeah that would be a different story. Did anyone actually notice?Yeah I did. We weren't sure if it was an earthquake or if EOD was getting froggy clearing explosives today. Did San Francisco forget where they live?
I'm fairly certain there was an SVU episode made in the early 2000s about him. I think a decent amount of the photographer interactions in Neon Demon were based on him as well, and that's a horror film.It was actually this movie that came to my mind upon hearing about these allegations Can you help me understand what was up with that movie?  What was the intent of all of the hypnotic scenes?  Where it would just be that music and the neon triangles, things like that.  I found it very soothing but have no idea what it was supposed to mean in the context of the movieI don't know if you have seen any other movies by the director of The Neon Demon, but hypnotic scenes with cool lighting are a favourite technique of his. I think in the context of that movie, it was to show her finding power in her beauty. A big theme of the movie is how the women are obsessed with beauty. That is how I interpreted it.Think the director is big on the art movement where shapes and colours influence mood and the overall atmosphere. think it's part surrealist Is that what that was? Could have been an abstract audi commercial from all i could tell.It wouldn't be the first time I felt scared watching an audi commercial such an aesthetically beautiful flick, I genuinely enjoyed it and the soundtrack was so great. The episode was actually from just last year, called Fashionable Crimes. The photographer had a fedora, gold chains and scruffy grey neckbeard, not exactly subtle. Yep. Dude wore a plaid shirt and all. Yep, Fisher Stevens was Terry. Also, are we going to gloss over the comment by the insider that a man who looks like him shouldn't be getting a lot of consensual sex?The only way you could not know Terry Richardson is a sleazy, sexually exploitative person is literally to not know who Terry Richardson is.So rather than say "good for Vogue", I'm going to say "Ok Vogue, so what the fuck was up with supporting him up until NOW?".They're literally trying to get out ahead of cutting ties with someone notorious for pulling out his dick and jacking off on models because they apparently just realized it's not cool any more.&gt;"Ok Vogue, so what the fuck was up with supporting him up until NOW?".It's amazing how willing these people and organizations are to ignore the utter moral failures of some fucked up people. Ailes ran a fucking harem at Fox and the people who knew it turned a blind eye. Vogue knew this dude was a fucked up pervert, but they turned a blind eye. Various folk in Hollywood knew Weinstein or Bill Cosby were rapists, but they turned a blind eye.Fuck all those cowards. If you only denounce this kind of shit after the person gets caught red-handed, you might as well have been enabling it.willing to bet there are others but since its not in the press yet they'll ignore itCurious to see what names pop up when this scandal leaks it’s way into the music industry. It’s only a matter of time.I'll call it:  Sean Combs really has people carry him around on his yacht and around his estate.&gt; The only way you could not know Terry Richardson is a sleazy, sexually exploitative person is literally to not know who Terry Richardson is.Yup this isn't something people with connections knew or even an industry open secret. This is his public image. He's worked hard to appear as a sleazy, sexually exploitative person. The only question there has ever been is has he done anything strictly illegal.&gt;The only way you could not know Terry Richardson is a sleazy, sexually exploitative person is literally to not know who Terry Richardson is.I am one of those people. Looked him up, and wowI hope you didn't Google him from work.I dont reddit from my work comp... mostly my phoneI VPN to a server at home and do all of my screwing off browsing remote.... They can log anything they want.  If I put half as much work into my actual job as I do into my screwing off I'd be a rockstarYou know what would have ground breaking Vogue.  Doing this before the Weinstein scandal, now you just look like you're playing catchup.Seriously people have known about Terry for years now and no one really spoke up and he’s worked with so many upcoming models,musicians and actors along with already A list stars and Obama himself.  This should have happened awhile ago. They aren’t even playing catch up, they are exposing themselves as being complicit. They paid him, and he produced the trash he produced. They are at fault here too. Now they want to act like they are doing something good. I thought that was the the CEO for American Apparel. Same shit, different name I guessBelieve or not, Dov Charney looks even sleazier than Terry Richardson[sometimes..judge a book by the cover](http://skepchick.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/terrydov.jpg)to me it's the style of glasses they wear. Yes, the "Dahmer" style.(I know these were popular in the 80s and are making a comeback, but I will always associate them a little with Dahmer). they're incredibly unattractive on 100% of people who wear them. sleazy middle-aged men and attractive young women alike. Yeah, I just see 80s dads.Guy on the right looks like someone mashed Jake Gyllenhaal's face with Mark Ruffalo's.it's those plastic 80s "part-time tennis coach" aviator glasses that does it. The fuck is wrong with Richardson’s eyebrows? Thyroid problem or something? Anyone who has seen any Terry Richardson photo shoot could have told you this. He is an absolute creep &gt; Anyone who has seen any Terry RichardsonSeriously, maybe it's just the combination of the glasses and the molestache but this guy has a face for a federal registry.And the fact there’s 100s of photos of him cumming on Model’s faces and cock slapping them. At best it’s abuse of power. Wait what? How is that in any way related to fashion photography.The whole fashion industry is Emperor's-new-clothes bullshit. A bunch of pretty idiots have convinced themselves that they're geniuses and so shit like this is accepted because it's edgy and confusing, no one really understands what they're supposed to take from it but they don't want to be the one to speak out and say the Emperor's naked because they have low self esteem and they don't realise that everyone around them is faking it as well. Zoolander is a documentary.He should take a page from Bob Shell about how horribly wrong things can go.The world is full of competent fashion photographers. Terry Richardson made a name for himself (although it helps he has familiy connections) by making his photoshoots an event. Models get naked. He gets naked. People who wouldn't normaly get naked get naked. Sex under questionable conditions happens. Drugs happen. And people talk about this hand the name Terry Richardson becomes known and he becomes the highest paid fashion photographers going.It isnt. He's a rapist.&gt;It isnt. He's a rapist.There is a slight lack of evidence of this. While he has always liked to have a persona that suggests that maybe he's crossed the line into something illegal there is no solid evidence that has. Yeah total lack of evidence... besides literally dozens of witnesses and the thousands of photos he took himself. No, at best, it is consensual sex.Hmm I kinda know what you mean but I think it’s exploitative. Not illegal but immoral, you hear about the guy in the UK that masqueraded as a film producer to bang lots of girls? When you can leverage someone implicitly or explicitly for sex or other favours, then i think it’s fucked up (if you don’t do x then you’ll never work in this town again). Same with Dov Charney at American apparel. I know nothing about the fashion industry. That sounds like assault. Why hasn't this scumbag been arrested before if there's photographic evidence?Someone has to make a complaint. Is he the dude that did the nsfw shots with Miley Cyrus because that's what the photographer looked like in some of the photos.For real - I worked freelance for the photo syndication agency he worked with and worked on building their digital archives. His shoots could be considered borderline sexual abuse in and of themselves. The ones that didn’t make it to Vogue could be pretty... intense. I recall hearing about his creepiness a while back from some random comment on a celeb sub.  I did a little digging and read random people talking about him exposing himself during shoots, doing/encouraging drug use, sexually assaulting models, and all kinds of other stuff that made me wonder why the guy wasn't in jail.  I think it was after Miley Cyrus did a shoot with him that I heard about this stuff.Didn't he do a photo shoot with Obama? If those had been creepy I think we'd have heard of them. [removed]"This is the life, kid. Now get on your back.""ya wanna be a *star*, doncha?"    -- The Opacity of Soap(Obama's unauthorized tell-all autobiography, coming soon)Really? Not *The Audacity to Grope*?*Veracity of Snopes*?Obama does not bend the knee.The people he takes photos with have this unwillingness in their eyes Yet all these hot new models and actresses shoot with him."Here's a thong and just wear it on that dirty air mattress " . He got some amazing shots. But he also did trashy shots like skidrow teddy bear cigarette butt themed trash All of his photos are the same. The women are made to looks sweaty with dirty hair, wearing panties with legs spread wide open, with something in their mouths, dripping down. Doesn't matter if it's a cracked out Lindsay Lohan or a decent actress in a children's TV show .. always the same. You should see the shoots he did where he’s pretty much forced the models to fuck him and blow him, he even “convinced”(probably do it or you’re blacklisted) one dude to piss in his own mouth for a shoot.Barack Obama seems to think he was an okay fella. https://andreawoo.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/terry_obama.jpgDid Barack make some kind of statement about him?  Because this pic just seems like someone got their photo taken with the President.Because Richardson took some pictures of him in 2007? Don't you feel a bit desperate right now?No, not really. This is just the internet, dude, I don't get that excited over things.But was he not a scumbag in 2007?I'm sure he was, but Obama was just getting photographed for the cover of Vibe Magazine, and Terry Richardson was the photographer that Vibe Magazine used. You think Obama researched the photographer's background to see if he had any rumors of sexual harassment? We're talking about a guy who photographed him one time, not a political adviser.It only took about 15 years and literally everyone knowing about it. hopefully the next time it won't take that long. even though this came way late, it still happened, which is good.[removed]I feel compelled to say this is simply not true. When he assaulted a model I worked with it was the early 00's and right before Terryworld came out. She was 19 or 20 and went on the shoot because her agent sent her and said he was a major photographer who could make her as a model. Are you saying it's her fault he exposed himself, hit her with his dick and then told her she was being taken off set if she didn't suck it??So many models have a this story about him. Within fashion he is known as a predator but editors and agents don't care about models. They are disposable, and can be abused and essentially thrown away.I would ask you rethink blaming Terry's victims based on your perception of his current fame.&gt; So many models have a this story about him. Within fashion he is known as a predator but editors and agents don't care about models. They are disposable, and can be abused and essentially thrown away.That is so fucked up. Aren't these people (the agents/editors) aiding and abetting rape then? Lock this sick fuck up, then go after everyone who helped and encouraged his assaults. Yeah, of course they are.But the models don't matter. Not to them. Easily disposable since it's a job that so many girls want but only few have.worked in production offices and overheard producers sweet talking their clients/talent into doing something. Soon as they're off the phone they backstab, bitch and moan about the person they were just super friendly too. They will say and lie about anything to get a good shot or piece of entertainment.  Thank you for phrasing this the way you did, it was very eye opening for me.  I knew models were getting taken advantage of, but I didn't see how it related to everything, didn't understand why it happened. The models are artists, they are driven to inspire others, and the people who are supposed to be guiding them are using up their inspiration, and then throwing them away.Another industry turning hope and souls into money.Another way for marketing to dance with humanity, destroying it from within, feeding on hopes, and whispering words thst dissuade inspiration and art and instead eagerly push thoughts of fame, money, and social isolation. https://youtu.be/3zUUtf7gOe8Thank you. I know it doesn't make sense in context here, but thank you for showing me that models are artists as well, and are much much more than just someone posing. &gt; Nothing wrong with his work as long as everyone consentedConsent becomes blurred when one of party has some kind of authority or incentivization that would leave the other party subordinate to said authority or incentive.Is it really consent if somebody with the power to determine the future of your career makes sexually suggestive remarks that imply a positive outcome if you go along with it and a negative outcome if you refuse?That's the problem. They only "consented" because he threatened to get their photos pulled from major magazines if they didn't "consent"That is not consent. HE works with major female celebs and of course he doesn't touch them.. . so they all say "oh he's fine!" but he coerces young men and women who are nobodies to do some pretty disgusting things on threat that he will kill their careers. Hasn't this been known for quite some time?Yes, but the balloon of sexual abuse in Hollywood has finally burst.Everyone knew that people were being raped left and right (the "casting couch") in Hollywood, but no one was being punished for it. Now that you have a major rich guy actually facing the consequences of his rape you are going to see all the lower-down rapists finally being punished. Let’s hope.That applies to dozens of people yet they all got away with it for years because they had power and women and kids don't.No, it wasn't really an open secret like Harvey. With Terry people had literally come forward and made allegations. Like a number of times.Right, but the thing is, everyone replied "yeah we know. look at him. he's a creep."You can say "people came forward about him already, this isn't news" but nobody fucking did anything. That's why it's news now. Vogue is shutting him down. Creep or not, dude has a lame schtick. I'd be glad to see his career end for multiple reasons. Same thing with Donald... there’s even audio evidence of him saying he can get away with it.  But, let’s all ignore that too.it may have been known, but this is the first time action seems to be taken, which is a positiveNot really, since many more people have been victimized by him after the 1st allegations surfaced. Damn, all of these high ranking positions are opening up left and right. Sweet, my resume writing business should be booming soon."According to our questionnaire, you marked that you've raped less than 4 women this year. I'm sorry, but company policy has found that a person who pulls double digits here is the kind of person we need."That dude is the definition of weaselly looks like it tooRed hair and a hand-me-down robe?Am I the only one who thought that article was a mess??THIS is WAAAAAAAAAY overdueI spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what "this powerful guy with a b**er" meant. Then I realized it was boner.Ah, thank you. Came looking for the answer. Fuck cencorsh*p, right?Well that's a 404https://www.gq.com/gallery/terry-richardson-best-of-photosHis photography style is borderline pornographic. Just watch that wrecking ball video he directed. Seriously Miley? Licking a sledgehammer from a downward angle. With glistening sweat. I have never understood why the entertainment industry took him seriously. It's just people posing provocatively in front of white backgrounds. Often overexposed to shit. His work is garbage.&gt; I have never understood why the entertainment industry took him seriouslyI bet he knew some secrets of his own that ensured he'd have the leverage to hang around. Perverts like him tend to attract other perverts, thus leaving themselves vulnerable to exposure if they don't get what they want.It's basic criminal behavior. They're all guilty of something and they'll do their best to make sure it never gets out of control if that means digging dirt on those who aren't guilty just to ensure they have the leverage to keep them quiet and compliant, until they're independently busted after leaving all that evidence around.The rawness of the images was the allure. Remember the video for Criminal by Fiona Apple? I think that's what started the trend in the mainstream. It was intended to seem intimate and amateurish. Voyeurism isn't intimate. There is a difference.I don't think I can watch that video again now. It always gave off a weird vibe. And the fact that this was another open secret is insane. Are pictures really so important to people that this is somehow okay in the industry? How many more open secrets will get exposed in the next few weeks? But I dread that this will be a trend of sorts and no change will happen. &gt; His photography style is borderline pornographic.He's produced pornographic work over the years. &gt;I have never understood why the entertainment industry took him seriously.Terry Richardson made a name for himself (although it helps he has familiy connections) by making his photoshoots an event.

And people talk about this hand the name Terry Richardson becomes known and he becomes the highest paid fashion photographers going.&gt; It's just people posing provocatively in front of white backgrounds.Now how many other fashion photographers have a style you can name? Anyway Richardson did shoot convetional fashion photgraphy from time to time and was certianly competent in that area. &gt;Often overexposed to shit.Something he's pretty good at playing with when most photographers try and avoid entirely. Being a horrible person doesn't make him a bad photographer.Is anyone honestly surprised?  Took them long enoughThis story is from [three years ago](https://jezebel.com/i-felt-a-dick-pressing-into-my-face-terry-richardson-s-1589474038) and make his behavior seem routine and rehearsed with his assistant. How anyone would hire him I do not knowHopefully these women and their statements make it to the police. He's got some explaining to do in front of a judge and jury.It would be a tough sell to a jury unfortunately. He was smart, having that assistant there to back up his testimony. Plus, all of it recorded with pictures that kinda look awesome. I don't think a DA would take the case, its too old and it has too many issues. That guys a real dirtbag, glad magazines aren't paying for him to be one. Wish a conviction could happen.What statements? What police?  Did we read the same article?Sounds like a bunch of degenerate sex that was consensual and may or may not have been influenced by his celebrity and prestige. https://jezebel.com/i-felt-a-dick-pressing-into-my-face-terry-richardson-s-1589474038Doesn't sound consensual"A dick pressing into my face" is the feeling I get when I read a Jezebel article.Sounds like the assistant was trying to get her to come back and somehow capture a "consensual" make-out session to try to "cancel" out the assault!It seems like a couple of women toward the bottom of the article claim they were pressured or bullied into sex acts. I'm just saying that you should contact police if you feel threatened or forced into sex. That way people can go to trial and either be found guilty or innocent. &gt; That way people can go to trial and either be found guilty or innocent. Or your rape kit can be locked in storage for 10 years until the freezer goes destroying any physical evidence of the crime. Oh, and if you don't have a rape kit done or any other damning evidence like video/audio recordings confessing to said rapes, then good luck convincing any prosecutor to try the case.Not to mention that you'll never ever work in the industry again, because the person who abused you has a lot of powerful friends, who like the abuser for their work, and don't give a shit about you.So what's the other option, don't try? I am not saying the system is perfect, but it is the system we have. I think a lot of work can be done to fix both the price of testing as well as how long it takes to test kits.People don't try because it isn't the price of rape kits or how fast they are analyzed that's the issue. The issue is that system victimizes you for coming out and saying you're a victim. https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/78nddy/former_president_george_hw_bush_accused_of_sexual/It's happening right now. Very true. Coming forward has got to cut so deep into a person, its one of the most difficult things to do because of the shame people feel. Its tremendous and it isn't given enough credit, just how awful that feeling is. To have to admit something that despicable was done to you. But when you don't come forward, it makes it that much more difficult to punish the person. Its a flaw in the system, but its a fact. Please go to the police, because people like this should not be allowed to do this.Oh I'm sure they felt *some* pressure - I mean, look at the guy.  I'm sure a lot of them even probably felt disgusted with themselves afterwards.  Some of them probably thought "eh... you gotta go what you gotta do" and did it to advance their career and regretted it afterwards. He's definitely a creep (although, I'd argue that the industry that enabled him to be a creep and turned a blind eye is just as guilty)...   but he's proudly said he was a pervert for years. It just doesn't seem like there's any actual crime here. (but yes, agreed, if you feel like you've been legitimately been assaulted, go to the police)&gt; (but yes, agreed, if you feel like you've been legitimately been assaulted, go to the police)Are you remotely familiar with the issues regarding police treatment and the legal process regarding assault?Sure there are issues but what do you suggest as an alternative, that they do not go to police?It’s about fucking time. He’s a known creep and I can’t believe it took this long. What they like the rats but they don't like the rats' milk?America loves people like this, until they get old. Look at Justin Bieber or any other young, attractive celebrity. They say that it's the 'power of influence' but if you're influenced by fame and celebrity, as many people (men and women) are, you're a slave to these people. As disgusting as it sounds, I doubt many of these charges, if any, will be brought because ultimately these people consented. Terry Richardson has all these outrageous photos to show, like the Kate Moss photo, that prove that everyone knew what he was doing. If you go to him, seeking his services after you're aware of his 'style', how could you turn around and be surprised he "thrust his groin into your face"?If you know a photographer has a habit of surprising models with hit penis jammed in their face, then yes...you should probably not be surprised when he jams his penis in your face.  However, that doesn't make it any less of a sexual assault.   the crime is his behavior.How long until there are accusations against Annie Leibovitz?Quite a long time. There are a lot of photographers out there who take photos of naked people and while yes there are plenty with issues (after all for a long time it was one of the few socialy acceptable ways to look at random naked women) there are plently without. For example if you want an underground photographer who takes photos of naked people with no known issues then try Richard Kern. Robert Mapplethorpe would be another well known case.Well she already has been found guilty for tax evasion. Dude...he charges 200k a day for photo shoots?  That's highway robbery!  There are millions of people who will do it for 500 bucks and the quality of their work is equally as good, if not better.  Hell, they won't even ask for medical benefits.  These companies that hire him could save millions of dollars and avoid negative publicity altogether.  Our entertainment culture is frightening on many levels...dear God.&gt;directed Lady Gaga's  "do what you want" featuring R. Kelly, which has never been released.michaeljacksoneatingpopcorn.gifWhat took so long? People have been talking about his creepiness for many years. This is like the 3rd time vogue has "banned" him so far, let's see if it sticks this time of if they'll just wait till the focus is elsewhere again This is so random but anyone else notice he kinda looks like Sarah Lynn's bear photographer step-dad in BoJack Horseman? Wonder if he was the inspiration. Wasn't this guy open about it? Where's the controversy? His "art" is self-explanatory. No story here folks!"He opened up for New York magazine and defended his controversial style of photography, which often features nudity and sexually explicit content."I don't have any regrets about the work at all," he told the publication when asked if he has ever coerced or pressured models during shoots. "Obviously I don't ever want someone to feel like that. It was never my intention. But also, people do things, and then they have regrets, and that's also nothing to do with me. Then don't do pictures like that again…I'm okay with myself about everything, and that to me is the most important thing."He also wrote an article for the Huffington Post, noting that he "accepts" how some of his more provocative work "courts controversy," and thus, as an artist, he "values the discourse that arises" from it."Firing rapists is so IN right nowIs he a rapist, though?about time that jumped-up 'hipster-dad' Richardson finally got whats coming to him, next the mob can take down the staff at American Apparell and Vice.&gt;“But nobody who looks like that gets so much consensual sex without abusing his power.”This is a fucked up thing to say about another person.  Harvey Weinstein was a creep and I'm glad he's out, but I hope we aren't headed for internet lynch mobs pretending male sexuality is creepy.And it's not just male sexuality. Lots of people like casual sex and dirty fun. And lots don't. When people who predominantly mix with the same types of people encounter the other kind, miscommunication and weird situations happen. So.. Did he rape people, or is everyone just trying to hang him as collateral damage because of the Harvey Weinstein scandal? What's going on here? It's not even collateral damage.  It's old news.  They've had a unofficial soft ban on him since the whole 2014 scandal.  Most people think they're doing this because it's an easy win and might distract from the questionable relationship between Conde Nast and Weinstein.  Or who knows?  Maybe it's just someone inside the company using the Weinstein momentum to make sure Terry never works for them again.Collateral damage.He didn't rape anyone. The models that are accusing him, and I don't doubt they are telling the truth (nor is Terry denying), that he whipped it out and started fondling them during the shoot. He also supposedly coerced, by simply asking them to participate in the nude/erotic shoots.Here's the problem with the Richardson situation however; the man shoots erotic photography/softcore porn. His work is known for raw, playful sexuality where he often incorporates himself into the work. *This is the style of art he is known for.* He's not Ansel Adams or Annie Lebowitz, so it's not like he pulled a bait and switch. These models know exactly who he is and what he shoots. And unlike Weinstein these situation happened during the photoshoot themselves; not at a bar or hotel room. Not during a casting session. Only during the course of the shoots themselves.He also didn't force anyone to participate. All these models signed consent forms. At any point any one of them could have gotten up and left (which a couple of girls did). No one was held against their will.Is he a perv and a creep? Yes. Is he a shitty photographer? Possibly (for the record IMO I think his work has gotten stale and repetitive). Is he a rapist? No.The closest analogy here would be gonzo POV porn where the director is part of the subject matter. Unless he's shooting celebrities, Richardson's body of work has always consisted of placing himself at the center of erotic situations with women. It shouldn't have come as a surprise. If they didn't want to be part of an erotic photoshoot with a naked middle age man, then they shouldn't have been at his studio, nor consented to be photographed that way in the first place.It's way more complicated than that. Yes, that's what his personal photography is all about.  But he's also a very big name in the fashion industry and does legitimate (if a bit racy sometimes) shoots for very much not-porn magazine and fashion promotions.If you show up to an art shoot of his, sign the release, and then act shocked?  Sure, that's bullshit.  But if you sign up for a high profile shoot for a fashion line, a non explicit shoot, and he "forces his groin against your face and demands a blowjob?".That's totally different, and you're completely ignoring that there's a hell of a lot more to the guy than the playfully creepy softcore porn photos that make it around.  He shoots for the cover of GQ, Vogue, etc.  He shoots for high profile mass media ad campaigns.   *That's* his real career and his real influence - his stupid "porn masquerading as art" schtick doesn't pay the bills.  An aspiring model might find themselves absolutely forced to put up with unwanted nonconsensual advances in order to avoid torpedoing their career.To quote him: "It's not who you know, it's who you blow" that advances a model's career.  Fuck that attitude.  Exactly if you're a model given the opportunity to have a spread in Vogue or Vanity Fair or whatever and they send you off to a photoshoot with Richardson and he rubs his cock on your face, that's really not what you signed up for.&gt;These models know exactly who he is and what he shoots.Hey look the most typical form of victim blaming. They knew what they were getting into! They wanted it!Not saying they wanted it nor deserved it, but they knew what kind of photographer he was before they stepped into the studio. He doesn't shoot flowers, or tasteful nudes. Once again: HE SHOOTS MODELS NUDE AND IN SEXUAL SITUATIONS STARRING HIMSELF. That's what his "art" is, that's what he is known for. Don't step into his studio and sign a consent form if you know ahead of time he is going to want to be gross with you on camera. That's not being a victim, it's being stupid.Reminds me of Mapplethorpe a bit. Similarly exploitative. &gt; This is the style of art he is known for. He's not Ansel Adams or Annie Lebowitz, so it's not like he pulled a bait and switch. These models know exactly who he is and what he shoots.it doesn't matter what  he's known for.  he could have an established record of sexually assaulting 100% of the models he works with...it's still sexual assault every time he jams his dick in someone's face without consent.The argument falls apart when inappropriate physical contact that was not expressly agreed to in a contract occurs (such as his dick making unsolicited contact with the model). This takes it into the realm of sexual assault. If the contract didnt say "and the photographer gets to rub his junk on you" then it is not fair to put that on the model. They agreed to the terms of the contract. Anything he is pushing beyond that is using his position to leverage/intimidate (coercion also makes it sexual assault) compliance from the model. I mean, everyone already knew that terry was a creeperHis harassment of women has been common knowledge.  Sad it took so long for repercussions. When Lady Gaga worked with him I was very disappointed. I'm glad he's being punished in some way, even if he might not ever go to jail. Yeah and for song that also had R.Kelly on it. That was the most naive and dumb thing she thought she could get away with. Thank god she came to her senses though.I really hope it was out of innocence instead of rug sweeping or worse, pressure to do so. I started reading up about it back then cause it seemed so not "her" if you are to believe whoever she is now. Looking back..... The split with her manager (plus his company so also no A&amp;R who was Vince Herbert at that time), becoming essentially steerless, drug issues, mental problems so much bad press for an underperforming album...she thought they were just badly portrayed like she was at that time. Until I guess she probably read up on Kelly's allegations or someone slapped some sense into her and dropped that hot mess project. Huh, Interesting. I'm a big fan of hers and I like learning more about her. Thanks for your insights.No problem, the only down side about reading up on people sometimes is that you also become their fan which happened to me in 2014 :)  Oh well. A lot of moral authoritarians here preaching their dogmatic purity and disbelief in female agency.   Sexists all of them.  Go back to fucking Saudi Arabia.  He's worse than Weinstein.It's a good thing we've been convinced to look at people as individuals rather than as members of ethnoreligious groups. Because if we hadn't been convinced of that, we'd be having a revenge pogrom now.If any of the stories about this guy are true, this shit is *long* overdue.After seeing just the pics he took of Mikey Cyrus I'm not sure why people are surprised. He's a fucking creep.Fuck yes, way too many accounts floating around about this slime ball.pretty sure terry was very open about what a perv he was.  kind of one of those "use at your own peril" kind of guys.  i'm sure vogue employs many many people who are just monsters anyway.Fuck Vogue...They have known for 15 years. Don't try to play Good Samaritan now. He probably wanted a raise or had a contract and this was their perfect out. This was pure business plain and simple. The fashion world has been like this for ages, hasn't it?  Watching the documentary [About Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHBr8n6qpPM), youth and sexuality is front and center, but because it is "fashion," it has a more respectable veneer than straight-up pornography.  Paulina Porizkova's quote stuck with me:  "What people called sexual harassment, we called compliments.  You know, when a 16 year old is flattered by a man pulling out his penis in front of her, that's kind of noteworthy."  In spite of all that, Porizkova emerged from those experiences well-grounded.  And she looks terrific.Nice ass covering vogue.Out of the loop, but where have I heard of this guy? I've heard like he's a creep, but creep != sex offender (in this case, apparently, though...)I hope nobody minds the tangent here, but why is "b**er" censored in the article? There is literally a picture of naked people in the article, and the subject matter is sex, but they cannot print "boner"? Is boner a bad word? The 200k a day is bad enough, but he actually abuses clients?  No no, this is all wrong.  He had them sign release forms?He even looks like a rapist Lots of people losing their jobs overseas because of rape allegations and sexual misconduct. Just take a look at foreign news feeds: It's Everywhere.His style has been done to death now anyway.Well, from what I can gather no kittens were molested during the shoots, so that's a relief.Terry Richards is a fuck
[deleted]Hopefully you'll be charged like one at least.&gt;Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.I really hope they catch him and he gets charged with the highest sentence possible.The community needs to come together and call out who this guy is.lol you're definitely not a new yorker, huh?Even still, when children are involved the community usually comes through.A terrorist or a child?A manbeing a terrible person does not make you not a person.Are you men or snakes that you would threaten a child?What is this from?

So the answer to your question is, "yes."&gt;wearing a dark colored hooded sweatshirt with a red shirt underneath, royal blue pants, and tan and brown boots.The fashion police have also been alerted.I trust Breezango will have this solved faster than 2B."His day will *not* be H."“Anti-white”You mean racist. Edit : So far, I’ve been called a white supremacist, snowflake, a racist, and a wide myriad of other names; to which I say grow up. You can not determine if I am any of those things by my 5 word post, you can only assume. Grow up. I think they're just going for clarity.  It's obviously racist.  we live in a sad world where you can't call a racist a racist anymore.Well... unless they're white...exactly. if this was a white man throwing shit on a black girl, people would have no problem calling him a racist. i would have no problem calling him a racist. cuz... he's a racist. just saying "anti-black" or "anti-white" doesnt really drive home the point. I personally witnessed a group of black men in California yelling hateful racist things at all non-blacks that were walking by. This included telling little white and asian kids that they were going to be slaves when they are older. Rape was the implication there. It was very shocking to see but people were trying their best to tolerate it.  I thought today's definition of racist was white./sIt is, since ONLY white people can be racist according to this logic. The terms may as well be synonymous if you really believe that crap, and if you listen to a lot of people who are at the forefronts of these movements, they absolutely do believe racism and being white are synonymous and inseparable.  I wonder what it means that I'm biracial. isn't anti-(any race) just a more specific denomination of calling someone racistGet out of here with your logic, you're ruining the narrative.What the fuck does that even mean? You are creating persecution in your head where it doesn't exist. *Anti-white* is a specific description of what was obviously a racist comment. We also use phrases like *anti-Semitic* to be more descriptive than "Man Says Racist Thing."^^Edit: ^^fixed ^^quotation ^^marksYou must not have read this nice little piece right here. https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97There is very much a large section of people who think anti-white racism isn't possible. They're the same ones that say they're not sexist for having only women on their editorial panel because of the made up wage gapIs this the same group that was 95% white women?[Here is a photo they shared on their twitter feed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ci7V02mXIAAs3eN.jpg:large) and posted it unironicly about promoting diversity. They love to pull the identity politics shit in their articles, but you can't help but notice the lack of males or anybody not white or asian in their little echo chamber.Sometimes when people argue on reddit I imagine all of them sitting in a room and myself standing up and shouting, "I AM A PIECE OF CORN! I AM A PIECE OF CORN!".And it takes the edge off. Thanks Tom Green.Honestly, youre wrong.The idea that minority groups cannot be racist against majority groups is not a "nonexistant" thing.It is a recent occurrence you may have not encountered, but to say it's a fantasy is to ignore a small but growing section of insanity in the public sphere. He didn't said minorities cannot be racist against the majority wtf?He's saying the description "anti-white" clearly is already calling him a racist, just adding additional information on who he is racist against.SMH... No reading comprehension in you. Nowhere in that article does it mention the word "racism" or "racist".  And although the hate crimes task for is involved, neither the news nor the police refer to this incident as a hate crime or even a *potential* hate crime.  This should be at least a little bit telling.What's your point? Anti-(race) kind of defaults to being racist.My children take public transport (including MTA busses in Queens daily) and so do I. This kind of garbage needs to be dealt with right away - I'm glad the perp was photographed and an ID was made public. Waiting for the follow up story when he is arrested and his name is made public. They need to fix the damn MTA.[removed][removed][removed]Why not format it like other hate crime articles?"Black man throws burning liquid at 13-year old's face after making racial slur."The liquid was burning?No. It was described as "briefly stinging her eyes" so probably a sugary drink.

I was trying to say that anti-color is racist but it seems to be an issue of anything against white people is in a different area. I've been called the same as the top commenter in this sub. Seriously people, calm the hell down and grow the fuck up.*Police are unsure if it was racially motivated.*'anti-white' I think the term they are looking for is 'Racist'Isn't that obvious from the term "anti-white?"

It's glaringly obvious to the point of ridiculousness that they did not say it. Is it illegal to say he's black in america? It's a pretty obvious narrowing feature that you can see pretty clearly on the images.I came for the shit show and got the shit show. [removed][removed]or jail...Hear, hear... I grew up in Boston, was one of a handful of white kids in every class I was in in Boston Public Schools (late 90s). Just taking the bus/train *to* school was a challenge. Overt racism every day. Targeted on so many occasions just for being white was just normal stuff. Then a year or two ago there was this "movement" at the famous Boston Latin School that black students were victims of racism by white students because of *perceived* racism and comments on social media where white kids merely disagreed with black lives matter as a cause... And the mayor took this seriously! The only racism I ever saw in Boston was from black kids against white kids and it was epidemic.  And unfortunately these are the kinds of things that lead people to become racist themselves and start supporting the far-right. If people *really* want to fight the growth of the far-right, they should end these double standards and this dialogue that white people are apparently the root of all of our societal ills. Things like changing the meaning of racism to include *institutionalized power* so that non-white *technically* now can't be racist against white people, to [professors outright calling for white genocide](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/11/drexel-places-controversial-professor-leave), have pushed more people to the far-right than anything else. I have been attacked by black guys dozens of times( i live in an area that is 50/50 overall but many areas are majority black) and have seen crazy levels of racism on a daily basis against whites, but In my life I have Litterally never seen a white person attack a black person in public. Check what’s going on with whites in South Africa nowadays. If anyone thinks it’ll be any different here they’re ignorant."When you hear a young man behind you say, 'Hold up, homes.  I want to talk to you about something,' you immediately have a decision to make: run or fight.  You don't get to turn around and assess the situation or wonder if he has good intentions.  If you run too often, they're going to target you even more or trap you.  If you fight too often, he'll start bringing his friends and you'll get mobbed.  The trick was to stand up every once in a while, even if you got your ass beat, until you'd earned enough respect as a scrapper that they'd learn to leave you alone."My classmate from southern Arizona said this to our class.  Those from nice, integrated or mostly white neighborhoods were aghast.  Those from the barrios just shrugged and nodded, because we'd all been there.anecdotally I was a white kid in a school that was 95% black luckily I was young enough most of the time to not realize what was going on. I did get in trouble for agreeing with a black person who said someone called them 'the N word' even though I heard them call themselves that all the time. My parents said my teacher was ready to put me up in front of the school as a lesson or something and they had to fight back pretty hard for my innocent mistake. My younger brother had to change daycares when he was in elementary school because he was the only white kid, and kept getting beaten up. I didn't go to a black majority school (it was Asian) but I did commute on a subway train with a black majority. And I was, let's just say, not treated well.Of course it is. We are a tribalistic species. Anyone with a goddamn brain could assume it happens in those situations but these loons tell us 'racism = power + prejudice'20 years ago  i took an english class, my teacher essentialy taught race relations and flat out said black people couldnt be racist. This isnt a new problem, but its one of ignorance as alot of people dont know racist means to hate one by race vs white people hating black people.The internet has given the ignorant a larger voice. (Edit) clearly english class didnt help my typing.It's been normalized through academia arbitrarily redefining racism to be racial prejudice plus "institutionalized power"  (whatever that means).Presto change-o, now no one has to feel bad about being prejudiced against whites!  It's not racism!I mean, what did we *think* would happen?  Or was that the point...?I live in va and its gotten really bad, race motivated attacks on white people are getting out of hand. Had a car of 4 black guys follow me and threaten to shoot me because I looked at them funny supposedly, they made tons of racist remarks toward me. Black guys try to start shit with someone(cashier, custoner etc) almost every time i go to a gas station, grocery store, bar, or fast food restaurant. Violence at nightclubs has increased and shootings by black males has increased. How is it normalized? The NYPD is investigating this as  hate crime. Wouldn't it just be "Man makes racist remark,..."Why is it anti-white?Just curious:  Would you prefer casual readers of the headline to assume that it's white on black racism?"Man makes anti-white racist remark"There, was that so hard?Which is also redundant since anti-white very clearly conveys racism. Doesn't anti-white imply the remark to be racist? Is it that hard to figure out? It does, but shh.. reddit’s user base is intent on being the victim of an article title.[removed]When people think of racism, I can guarantee that 99% of people aren't thinking of anti-white racism[removed]If black people both commit and are victims of the most hate crimes compared to white people, then I'm a little confused on the math. What third party is skewing the data?1.) Roughly half of hate crimes are racially motivated (the rest include religion, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation)2.) Other races confound the data3.) This is a per-capita comparison being madeIt's probably something like all of the black on X hate crimes are fairly evenly distributed amongst other races while hate crimes committed by other races are all mostly against black people. At least, that's the only way those statistics could makes sense to me.The point is that 'per-capita' is something that sounds statistically useful, but actually obscures a more complex story. How did it obscure anything? What you presented are two completely different statistics, one where per-capita is an extremely useful way to equalize population sizes, the other where it doesn't even factor into it. [removed]Dr. Van Nostrand?Mr. Vandelay. I'm a big fan of your architecture style. [removed]I asked for the source. I didn't refute his claim. My statement is still correct: the media publishes what sells, not statistical reality. It's the same with stories about guns. There are millions of cases of responsible gun use every day but you're only going to read about the *mis*use because that sells papers and generates outrage. Outrage = money. It's even worse if a media outlet has a narrative to push because of the bias of its journalists.&gt;There are millions of cases of responsible gun use every day but you're only going to read about the misuse because that sells papers and generates outrage. Outrage = money. Or uh, something being used prosaically for its intended purpose isn't news?Then, yeah I agree with that. The media decides who it wants as the perps and victims, who should be outraged and happy, etc.  and finds stories that fit. I think you should edit your post for the tone, it comes off as your attacking the person above for asking for the source and makes your post harder to read and kind of turns people against what you're aiming for, which is enlightening them of some information.Just a friendly tip Citation needed https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/offenders_finalI don't think it qualifies as *substantially* higher, but it is indeed higher per capitaAre those anti-white, though?Because the remark was supposedly anti white. Is there something wrong with the headline being specific? Damned if you do damned if you don't situation.If the headline just said "Man makes racist remark" reddit would be bitching about how it doesn't say the man was racist against white people.These stories attract very unsavoury people to the comments section.Lol, if the headline said "Man makes racist remark" people here would be complaining how the headline doesn't mention it was racist against white people...Any given post someone is going to complain about the headline. It doesn't matter what it says.It's both.  The article is just being more specific.For some fucked up reason people truly believe that you can't be 'racist' to white people, you know because 'privilege' and stuff...**It is still Racism**as others have pointed out because everyone assumes it's a white perpetrator of the remark. Same thing when you hear "40 year old rapist caught" you think of a maleUnless it's 30 year caught having sex with student which, oddly, I now assume to be a woman. Times have changed. People would assume it was a white person attacking a non-white person and it most likely wouldn't get as many clicks from places like Reddit.You are getting so hung up on a couple of words; I bet you're the type that complains about people always being offended. Like, it's pretty obvious that "anti-white remark" means racist. I don't understand why you people are getting so pissy.Because you can't be racist against white people, don't you know? It's just "an affirmative action". /s&gt; Because you can't be racist against white peopleThere are some people who actually believe this.The most outwardly racist person I have ever met believed this, and said he couldn't be racist because he was black. I think the mentality really set himself up for failure in life. Kinda the same thing with me.A Arab/Muslim girl I knew and was friends with for years, who was pretty chill and super nice, suddenly did a 180 and started hating anything white.White privilege this, anti-capitalism that. Even though her father forced her to wear a hijab and was a high up guy at a pretty massive company and got her internships every summer, I was the oppressive one with privilege, because I was white. Which is even more weird since Arabs are basically white.Reminds me of a guy from middle school who punched me, told me I couldn't punch him back because he's black, and that it would be racist. He got punched back.Not a bad dude by any means, we're friends now, but damn if he wasn't acting a bit dumb back in the day. &gt; I think the mentality really set himself up for failure in life.Sounds like an almost pathological inability to take responsibility for himself. I agree, not a winner mentality.Anytime something doesn't go your way, it's not your fault it's racism. It's an easy cop out and lots of people would rather point the finger than blame themself.and a big reason why there is so much backlash against the BLM movementI had a really good black friend growing up who just one day flipped a switch and started hating all white people including me. He once told me that black people can't be racist and that all white people are racist because they allow discrimination to exist. It's sad that people don't understand that they've become what they hate.They just try to make it so that "racism" means something other than racially motivated predjudice, and therefore it doesn't 'technically' count. They think that it's the word that matters and not the act. As long as they can change the meaning of the word, the actual acts and reality don't matter!If the remark had instead been anti-Black, do you doubt for a second the race angle would have been included in the headline?  I don’t.I wouldn't even bother trying to argue with the original guy's comment. If it hadn't said the race it would have been "Well the didn't include the race you KNOW what that means!" but when they do it's "Why did they include the race? They're just trying to push race!" There's no winning.I was wondering this too. I tried to find similar instances of hate crimes against black people. Most hate crimes against black people are accompanied by racial slurs:[Teen girls using racial slur](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-of-teen-girls-shouting-racial-slur-under-investigation/)[Suspect yelled racial slur before attacking black man with machete](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-suspect-yelled-racial-slurs-before-attacking-black-man-with-machete/)[Racial slur found on campus](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/racial-slur-framingham-state-university-students-scared/)[Parents outraged at racial slur](http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2017/10/24/pope-john-paul-racial-slur/)Maybe the suspect in this article simply said something like "Fuck white people!" instead of using a racial slur like "Go to hell, cracker!" Its because "cracker" is not considered a racial slur by most, its almost a joke, any white person says he called me a cracker, they would get laughed at, but say the n word and all hell breaks loose.  Personally I'd like all headlines to say which form of racism it is.For clarity?Are you accusing the news of reporting too many details?Because hatred towards white people is approved racism. Racist seems to be a very strong word for some people when it comes to discrimination against white people.Don Lemon's reaction to the Chicago kidnapping, e.g.Are people still surprised that everything becomes white vs black anymore? The media fuels it. Politicians fuel it. Feminism and black lives matter fuels it. The republican seem to have not moved past the 70s on race relations. Thats all we talk about in the us now. Race. Never to unite us either. Always to divide. We are stuck in a one or the other narrative. Your either a piece of shit white person who needs to pay black people for slavery they themselves never experienced or you are a white supremacist who hates black people. I can't just be a white guy who wants to get along with peopleEdit: I am either being massively trolled, in which case nice job everyone, or there are a lot of ignorant assholes who have to be right. This is for any future response. I think black people have been descriminated against in the past. I do not think that your race will hold you back in the current age America. I think there are massive problems with the police. We need to end the military style police force we have. I think the war on drugs was bad and needs to end. I believe that poverty is one of the biggest issues holding back black Americans and we need to address.People on the left and right have caused the divisive state we live in. I was hoping that maybe we could move past racial differences and fix some of the countries issues.Democrats bring up race in to every situation far more often than republicans...but I agree with the rest of itSo he attacked a 13 year old girl.....from behind... then ran away. That is an automatic man-card revocation. Sadly, had the assailant been white, it would have been part of the headline.It's not "anti-white" it's a racially driven crime. Don't tip toe around it call it what it is. The color of someone's skin shouldn't change what a crime is labeled as. I'm sure her privilege blocked it from hitting her/sWe cannot allow any kind of acid attacks to become normal and we must use full force against anyone who throws liquid like this in public.Seriously, if you witness something like this you are fully within your rights to body slam that fucker to the ground. You should just assume it’s acid and ask questions later.From the article "It is believed the liquid was some kind of beverage, 1010 WINS’ Juliet Papa reported."Man is an asshole.More news at 11. *racist* asshole, but yea, huge asshole.Never met a racist that wasn't an asshole. Seems redundant. You have, you just don't know it.Racist here.  I never tossed anything on a black person.  I will nod if I make eye contact with a black guy, same as I would with a white guy.  I will even hold a door open for a black person who is following close behind me.  Being a racist does not mean you have to be disrespectful.  Most people are racist, it is natural.  A lot of people do not even recognize that they are racist because they are not being disrespectful to others for no reason.  People recognize that others are different and that influences how they think about them.  An ape shares around 96% of the same dna as a human, would you trust an ape walking towards you?  Naturally you would not.  A black man is more like me than an ape, so I would trust him before the ape as I can better gauge what his intentions are.  A person from your culture is even easier to judge as you have a better idea of what they are like.  Through evolution people from your culture would look just like you.  It was easy to spot an outsider.  Now we mix far more and evolution has not caught up.  It takes a while.  A few generations ago blacks were not thought of as people and it was acceptable to own them. Human nature simply does not change this fast.  In the end, just accept that we are racist, recognize it, and be respectful.  Beyond that, if you really hate a certain group, dont hang around them.  If you hate white people, you will not enjoy a country music concert.  Just dont go there.  Hate muslims?  Why the f are you standing outside of the mosque then?  You know there are a bunch of muslims in there right?  Just go somewhere else.  When you wrap bacon on the door handles you are just inviting interaction.  If you hate them, why do something that gets them to come over to you?  You wouldnt sit in the stands of a tennis match and cry about how much you hate tennis and everything about it...would you?  I hope this makes some sort of sense.  I understood (but not necessarily agreed with) the point you were trying to make until you got to the part about wrapping bacon on door handles. I hope you don't get downvoted into oblivion as you sounded like you were trying to be open and honest about your opinions. And since it is not a popular opinion to have on this very liberal site, have an upvote for your honesty.Why does the headline say "anti-white remarks" and not "racist remarks"?

Could be wrong (I'm ignorant).&gt; Why does the headline say "anti-white remarks" and not "racist remarks"?

The [pig's blood bullet](https://www.snopes.com/rumors/pershing.asp), the killed by women thing, etc. They just know that Muslims have some issue with pork, so they think any use of it would be offensive or even harsh for them. It's still offensive, if ignorant, but what do you expect? Little things like this spread like wildfire.Because the left doesn't know what the definition of racism ishttps://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwzjvz/dear-white-people-please-stop-pretending-reverse-racism-is-realHey hey. Don't lump everyone who isn't right leaning into the same thing, as I wouldn't lump everyone who *is* right leaning in the same measure as neo-nazis. I'm a dark skinned mutt, and I can easily acknowledge with examples of minority on white racism. I've had coworkers and friends who have been victims of racism, and have had long discussions with someone who had white guilt about white privilege, which I don't necessarily agree with (I mean, you can't choose how you're born. I understand some people have an argument for rich dynasties and how they got that money, but the average white person isn't from a rich dynasty.)Of course, it can manifest is much more benign and all encompassing ways, such as the thought you may get when seeing an out of place race at a specific culture restaurant (I've caught myself wondering at a white person behind the counter at a Caribbean place, but also about Black people at the kitchen in a KBBQ themed place.)Ugh. That's absurd. For everyone to be truly equal, no one can be special. But everyone wants to be special so now we're all just plain fucked. Math is also racisthttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/teaching-maths-white-privilege-illinois-university-professor-rochelle-gutierrez-a8018521.htmlI don't even know where to start with this one.How about the root of the word algebra. Sound Arabic? Because it is. Also, that article was written very poorly. The complaint was about mathematics when they should have spent significantly more time focusing on journalism.Upvoted for honesty and a somewhat reasonable explanationIt really doesn't make a lot of sense. If you are racist fine but don't generalize the human species in a manic effort of cognitive dissonance. It is in our genes to initially judge someone as it helped our species fitness, but that is entirely different from what a racist is. You are a judgemental asshole and so am I but only one of us is racist.Got to say, my curiosity of how Reddit is going to take this comment is strong. No popcorn available, Kettle brand chips and potato chowder is going to have to do.I appreciate the honesty.Though I'm curious, what do you define as racism? Assuming things about people's nature or behavior based on their racial and cultural traits. Usually happens in the absence of all other information about said person, and gives way to a more reliable assessment the more you interact with them. Everyone does it involuntarily, but it's only a crutch that's used when you have no other way to assess others. That's why most people try to get to know new acquaintances as soon as possible. Not him, BTW.I would agree that everyone does this. That is definitely natural. However, I have never considered this to be the definition of racism. I thought racism revolved around an active/passive discriminatory action towards someone based on their racial or cultural traits. Being a racist therefore requires participating in these active/passive discriminatory actions. If you don't do that then you're not a racist. I appreciate the answer. Just trying to understand the definition of racism and being a racist. I personally didn't think OP's comments implied that he was actually a racist, although he said he was.Imagine I am driving around LA and got hungry and am looking to eat. I purposefully avoid all black neighborhoods at night because I know they are far more dangerous. Does that make me racist?&gt;You wouldnt sit in the stands of a tennis match and cry about how much you hate tennis and everything about it...would you?Oh, my sweet summer child, you'd be surprised.&gt; Most people are racist, it is naturalIn university, Asians only speak and befriend other asians. Same with Arabs, Indians and blacks. It's casual racism. [removed]I thought only white people could be racist./sWait, I thought black people couldn't be racist? What a p.o.s. but black guys cant be racistLet's not jump to conclusions. The man might have simply hated white people. No need to cry racistThis thread quickly devolved into the usual black vs white conversation.  That's all people ever see now.  It's funny how in an era of social progressives, we are increasingly focused on race and what value we place on it.Lol maybe you should read or watch the video. If this does not get the same upvotes or is up on the front page around the same time frame of reversed situations, something is wrong.It won't, because there is a certain narrative that the majority of this community loves to hear, and this certainly doesn't speak to it. If in fact this does garner the same publicity as other articles of a similiar nature, I'd be happily mistaken.I doubt that. Didn't the thread about the four black guys that tortured a white disabled guy get like 88K upvotes? Whether or not major left wing papers publish it as a major story remains to be seen but I'm fairly confident this will reach the front page.lol, no kidding. /r/news is not the subreddit where anti-white stories get pushed down. Some users here are incredibly brainwashed.It's on the front page...I love reddits "doesn't follow the narrative" narrative.Every thread there's some idiot saying "this doesn't follow the narrative it won't garner publicity"...while it's garnering publicity.Everybody wants to think their views are being suppressed because they're obviously right and everyone else is brainwashed. It's not and they're not and this post is on the front page. Your views aren't special and we're all idiots.you jerkoffs do realize that you're commenting on an article on the front page of r/news, right? reality not good enough for you?It already did. Stop bullshiting.Saw this on my front page. Myth bustedInteresting. It's the top of /r/news, and look at all the top comments.You guys are really desperate to be victims huh?I have a question: do you feel like a complete idiot commenting on how posts like this don't get enough attention while they are upvoted to the top of the sub?Is this a competition to you? The ads on this video make it nearly impossible to watch. Garbage linkA young girl though. What a bitch.That's not racist because....what?Smh as a black man in today's social climate this really pisses me off. Racial Injustice goes all ways and it takes a real dumb or sick individual to think thay this is some type righteous act or something. This piece of shit deserves to be found and thrown into the dirtiest corner of Rikers Island. Can't wait for anarchists to turn up and say this was justified.Wait a minute. I thought it was impossible for anyone other than white people to be racist?Anti-white??Isn't that just racist?yes absolutely, however, if they just used the word racist, then 99.9% would assume the assailant was white. which is kinda racist in its own way.Nonsense, racism = power plus prejudice, so white people can never be the victims if racism! This huffington post blogger and my womens studies professor says so, therefore it has to be a fact!!https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97/sThe most racist people I have ever seen are black.We calling this racist yet, or are we still racists if we dare to defend a white person?But Reddit said white people have always been privileged and get everything free. My fucked up knee with no healthcare disagrees. Who on reddit has said this?What Reddit have you been on?Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.That's not what white privilege is at all. White privilege isn't a one way ticket to prosperity. All it means is that in any given situation, being white tends to be easier than being a person of color. There's also the privilege of being rich, not being disabled, etc. No "privilege" is a get outta lifes troubles free card. Well, except maybe rich privilege.How would you feel if anytime a Black individual used his race card in an argument, a conservative went "OHHH THERE HE GOES USING HIS BLACKKK PRIVILEGE AGAIN!"? It's condescending, racist, and the colloquial version of it is typically used to demean someone else's accomplishments based on nothing but race. A White kid growing up in inner city Baltimore is demonized for being White, bullied for it, and molded by such abuse, yet somehow he still fits under this MASSIVELY broad term. I must disagree. I don't feel it's true that "in *any* given situation, being white tends to be easier than being a person of color." I will agree that in *some* situations it's easier being white but in other situations it's easier being black or another minority. It does seem it's always easier if one is rich.I think you haven't been on reddit for very long if you think that reddit hates white people.I mean the token reddit audience is probably mostly white dudes who are either college aged or exiting college.That said, I think you're confusing Reddit with the crazier College diversity departments.I figure the white privilege theory is basically due to some statistics that more or less say that white people are better off as a whole, even if they might be wrongly attributing causation over correlation.Overall I think the biggest issue is that some people from minority backgrounds live in communities that aren't strongly suited to raising successful people. For instance single parent households have some correlation with crime rates and low income. It's a lot easier to be wealthy when you have two parents that can either both work jobs, or have one parent raising the kids while the other works. If you are raised in a "bad neighborhood" with a higher crime rate and higher unemployment, I kinda think you're more screwed then a person with lower crime rates and higher employment.Most people on reddit will probably agree that the perpetrator was a racist for singling out a little white girl, even if some of them will probably insist that reddit is also racist for not raising attention to POC victims of racism.Reddit isn't some tumblr stereotype, everyone here has differing motivations and the hiveminds only really exist because people enable them.Overall I think people confuse racist problems with classist ones, poor people tend to be more screwed then rich people unless they can claw themselves out.ITT: Either reddit is racist against white people so this will never get traction or its racist against non white people and its going straight to the top.Also a handful of people who have a deep misunderstanding of the term white privilege. 

Unfortunately cyber security is just not important to leaders who make a name off of "operational cost savings". You are so totally right, man. 

&gt;”He didn’t shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again. Barbara rolled her eyes as if to say ‘not again.’ His security guard told me I shouldn’t have stood next to him for the photo.”What was the joke?EDIT: This was the joke:&gt;”He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, ‘**Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?’ As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, ‘David Cop-a-Feel!’”**an apparent sexualized reference to famed magician David Copperfield.Do you have a bush in those panties? Would you like one?I can totally see Dubya doing a bump and saying that to a girl while he was in college. Not old enough to remember his daddy as anything other than an old man, though.&gt;Would you like a Bush in those panties?Well back in those days, most girls were already spoken for in that category.edit: damn words"Do you have a bush in those panties?""Yes, I do!""Oh...OK. Wanna have sex?"I would have went with "would you like another?" ...that was pretty obvious in retrospect.You lost this time kid. But next time you crack that joke, by god you're guna nail it.Do you want to see my weapon of mass destruction?More like Ass destruction"What's the difference between jelly and jam? Who cares - I'm 93 and my dick won't do shit."What's the difference between a chickpea and a garbanzo bean. I wouldn't pay $500 to have a garbanzo bean on my face thats pretty good im gonna take ityoink Something something "read my lips.""I'd love to read your lips."This sounds more like senility and mental illness than anything else.Right? I wouldn't say forgive and forget, but in general there should be a separate charge for sexual assault if the person is suffering dementia. It's still wrong, but many mental disorders fuck with your inhibitions. It shouldn't purely be seen as maliciously criminal, just something to be avoided if possible. My (ex) Sister in Law is a nurse, she was always called to geriatric care, as such worked as a charge nurse at a nursing home for a long time.  She got her ass grabbed more times than she could count by old farts who didn't know up from down.  Funny thing though, is the male nurses got the same thing from female nursing home residents.  We as a society give a lot of leeway to folks with dementia, for I think pretty good reasons.  They quite literally don't know what they're doing, or don't understand who is who, the circumstances, etc.  edit:  I think why this actress felt inclined to share her experience isn't just the #MeToo movement per se, but it's partly due to a super common lack of understanding how old folks behave.  We've walled off our senior citizens into enclaves of retirement communities, assisted living centers, and nursing homes.  So much so - many of us today aren't really aware of how old folks, especially those with some level of dementia - behave.   Male nurse here.  I can vouch for that.  I get hit on nearly every day by one of my female residents, and I'm positive she doesn't remember who I am the next time I see her.  It's like a bad version of 50 First Dates.I spend so much time pinching my wife's ass daily that I'm seriously concerned about the muscle memory response when I get decrepit.That's a genuine concern I would say. I nearly gave my MIL's ass a pat as I walked by until I saw my wife around the corner. Managed to turn it into a tap on the back as I walked away.It was at that moment I was concerned I couldn't tell them apart while bent over but comforted that they had good genes that held up well over time. I've been in this situation several times myself. My wife asked me if I'll love her when she's old and gross and I said "you'll never be gross."She asked me how I could possibly know that and I said "Have you seen your mom? She's still got it, and you got those genes, so I'm not worried."So naturally my wife tells her mom that I think she's hot...I've managed to avoid that because that's exactly what my wife would do. And then they would both find it hilarious. Then her mom would tell her sisters and then Christmas is soon so I would get a bunch of knowing smirks that turn to laughter.It would all be good natured and fun, but I would turn red, for sure. Well let’s see those photos then![Photo](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=george+w+bush+sexual&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;dcr=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFn_nnmozXAhVI0hoKHWG1Cd0Q_AUICygC#imgrc=2Xul9dYtonYJ1M:) of the incident in question.Honestly, we are talking about an old (93), senile man in a wheelchair here. He probably can't raise his arm any higher and isn't mentally firing on all cylinders. I think calling this sexual assault is a bit of a stretch.   Worked at a retirement home for about a year and was on the receiving end of many a goosing.  Realizing that most of the lot was either senile or near-death, I tried not to take it too personally.&gt; What was the joke?Why did the chicken cross the road?What does Saddam Hussein and Little Miss Muffet have in common?They both had Kurds in their way. I'm sure he's at least heard that one during his time in office.To find some new taxes.So if he did this all while being photographed, we should have some solid evidence, right?I think the real news here is that AOL is still a thing.I think it was bought out by someone though. ISIS maybe. Or Comcast. One of those terrorist groups. &gt;one of those terrorist groupsProbably Comcast. It was Verizon.When I hear terrorist I think telecomMy dad still pays for it. Cause he doesn't want to give up the user name. He [apologized](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/25/report-george-h-w-bush-apologizes-after-sexual-assault-allegation.html):&gt; “President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind," the Bush spokesman said in a statement to Fox News. Well someone apologized for him anyway.No, he speaks in the third person and is known as the "Bush Spokesman".Bush whisperer*I don't even think the dude could form a coherent sentence at this point.  Yeah. He's got dementia in his old age. He probably thought she was someone famous by mistake.Most underrated comment I’ve seen here.“What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really.”That’s an interesting view on acting. Talk about delusions of grandeur.Especially since I’ve never heard of her or her show until this articleI read the article but still didn't understand. Did he actually grope the actress or did he scrape her with his chair? He basically doesn't have the motor function capability to intentionally sexually assault someone.He can quite literally, barely wave.I don't know who this actress is but this is a pathetic and transparent attempt to exploit the current animosity towards Republicans and the very serious issue of sexual assault.  There are people out there who have legitimate sexual assault stories that will be taken less seriously thanks to stunts like this.I think this quote tells you all you really need to know about her:&gt;What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really. I can enact positive change. I can actually help people. I can be a symbol of my democracy. I can refuse to call him President, and call out other abuses of power when I see them. I can vote for a President, in part, by the nature of his or her character, knowing that his or her political decisions must necessarily stem from that character.”She has 6,124 followers on Instagram.  So yeah, she basically has the same power and reach as the President of the United States. /sYeah.  I cringed so hard I chipped a tooth when I read that.If you're not going to vote for HW because he doesn't have strong enough character, I'm legitimately curious who you'd vote forIt's disgusting really, and lessens the impact of real sexual assault cases.That’s the point, she wants you to know who she is...badly. Yeah this is pretty obviously just some attention-whore trying to use current events to get more famous.  She's a healthy adult and he's an ancient cripple who wouldn't shock anyone by dying next week, and she wants to act like he made her feel unsafe?  I mean rarely have I ever felt a desire to defend a Bush but holy shit lady grow up and fuck off.He has poor motor function and tapped her from behind (while in his wheelchair and Barbara was right next to them) then he told her a joke described as "dirty". This is not "sexual assault". The actress just wants attention and it is now trendy to pretend to be a victim of sexual assault for news headlines. It says "touched".  This could be grabbing her ass, touching her lower back... maybe grabbing her hip.   I'm assuming if he touched her ass (which is the worst of the three), she would have said it. Even if he did do that, I think we're stretching the term "sexual assault" a bit thin, here.  What about someone touching a woman's bare shoulder?  #MeTooYup, it seems super vague, but I would want to know more in order do make up my mind.In this case "sexual assault" is tapping her from behind in his wheelchair while Barbara was right next to him and telling her a "dirty joke". The way people are loosely using "sexual assault" these days is abhorrent. It diminishes real sexual assaults and victims.yeah, the "assault" part is important. Edit: Because people took issue with how I was defining assault, despite it not being an attempt on my part to define it legally, I will only say that there are other ways of describing the incident that do not in print equate it with much more egregious actions that often (though not necessarily) involve physical violence or restraint.What President Bush did was inappropriate, but I seriously doubt that it was as scarring as what was done by someone like Weinstein, O'Reilly, or any number of systematic, aggressive people who cultivated an air of dominance and perpetrated partly to satisfy their own power fetishThat all said, it's not as though we should ignore it. It's bad. We just need to make sure we don't get to the point in conversation where the words don't have any real meaning. **I take issue specifically with the headline, which, when I read it, led me to believe that Bush pursued this actress aggressively perhaps years ago. Something like that would be a completely different story, and the headline writer knows it**Edit 2: This was inappropriate and should be called out as such. I've never meant to imply otherwise. This is an important discussion, however, and I would simply like our news organizations to have the decency of not using language that they know is misleading in the context in order to draw in readers, demonstrating that they value money over the feelings of the woman in question. Call it out, but don't pretend that this headline isn't doing exactly that, and that politicizing it is dangerous to the movement that has succeeded so far in convincing otherwise apathetic individuals to become introspective and start to see why such things are inappropriate. Taking something that those people will think is frivolous and explaining why it isn't may change hearts and minds; labeling everything as the same is a sure way to lose credibility Yeah I mean I don't want to be one of those guys that downplays sexual assault but it really seems more of an old guy touching a girl from wheel chair height to get her attention then telling her a dirty joke. They keep saying "touching from behind" I feel like the vagueness of this implies ambiguity of whether it was touched in an inappropriate area or just near one like her butt since he's in a wheel chair. If he grabbed her butt that's bad but why not say that. Also hate to be this guy but this quote from the *victim* about it does come off like being an opportunist with the #metoo stuff. She talks about it as though she's the vanguard for democracy and resistance because an old man in his 90's may have touched her butt and said a dirty joke. &gt;“**What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really**. I can enact positive change. I can actually help people. I can be a symbol of my democracy. I can refuse to call him President, and call out other abuses of power when I see them. I can vote for a President, in part, by the nature of his or her character, knowing that his or her political decisions must necessarily stem from that character.” As a woman that quote actually makes me mad. I hope she faces a lot of backlash for this. It is disgraceful. She sounds like the sort of person who would claim to be close with someone she barely knew after they died so she could get sympathy and attention. "What comforts the bereaved is that I too can use their death, which isn't so different from the deceased's family members really. I can enact Facebook statuses. I can actually out-mourn people. I can be a symbol of my vanity. I can refuse to call the deceased a stranger, and call out others who say I didn't even know them when I see them. I can press like on *My Condolences* posts, in part, by their total lack of character, knowing that his or her decision to make a stranger's death about them must necessarily stem from that character."Good valid points.  Afraid of their wellbeing from a guy whose about 1000 and in a wheel chair? They weren't in danger for one second. It's gross and embarrassing but people as old as him are basically children. She's being ridiculous.&gt; Afraid of their wellbeing from a guy whose about 1000 and in a wheel chair?To be fair, if he's managed to live that long, he's likely a wizard and fear would be a rational response./edit/ Case in point: [Lo-Pan](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Lo-Pan)You'd think we could expect more from AOL News!All joking aside, I agree. That's an intentionally misleading headline.&gt; It diminishes real sexual assaults and victims.This is what i keep trying to say.When Black Lives Matter people brigade a Bernie Sanders rally, if anyone was about to help your visibility this was the guy.Making noise and headlines there dilutes your message.When you holler: * sexual assault when a 93 yr old man taps your thigh * pedophile to an 18 yr old with a 17 yr old significant other* racist because mcdonalds won't refund your half eaten cheeseburger... ***it dilutes the message.***There was a great article about that on Bloomberg yesterday [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-24/be-careful-who-you-call-a-white-supremacist) about the overuse of terms like that, and how it leads to desensitization to the real thing&gt;It only makes sense to redefine words in this way if you believe that there is literally no difference between David Duke and Mitt Romney, between the Jim Crow South and modern America. There is a difference. We need to continue to draw a firm verbal line between them. If we don’t, we are helping our common enemy to camouflage themselves and slip into the general population.I feel like I've been screaming at a brick wall for the past two years or so now. Words matter. Definitions matter. Unfortunately a lot of people these days have become very comfortable arbitrarily redefining terms to suit their needs because it's the only way they can win arguments and they refuse to acknowledge that their own positions may not be tenable. It creates an environment where everything starts to lose meaning and no common ground can be achieved, which only furthers animosity and makes actual conflict resolution less and less likely, but you can't tell these people that because they aren't really interested in solutions to problems, they're interested in preserving their self-delusions about their own intelligence and righteousness.Yeah, this woman is clearly jumping on the bandwagon here, and it's pretty shameful given the old age and physical incapacity of President Bush. She's taking advantage of an old, sick, wheelchair-bound man to attempt to further her own career and fame. It's pretty obvious she's doing this when you look at some of her quotes: &gt; What comforts me is that **I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really**. I can enact positive change. I can actually help people. I can be a symbol of my democracy. I can refuse to call him President, and call out other abuses of power when I see them.Talk about egotistical. “What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really."Really? Thanks for the laugh.BTW 1 in 10 people who reach 60 will suffering a mental impairment like dementia. If a person does reach 90 they will most likely suffer serious mental and or emotional impairment. Go spend any amount of time in a nursing home and you will see patients saying/ behaving/ and acting in all manner of inappropriate ways.  Before the advent of modern medicine usually a person's body would give out well before their minds would have. The majority of us who live a healthy lifestyle will reach our late 80's and early 90's and the last decade of most of our lives will dealing with growing cognitive and emotional decline with a growing need to be cared for by others. Growing old sucks. My grandfather came to believe my mother(his daughter in law) was his dead wife and would hug and kiss her and expect to spend time with her all day during his dementia. It was incredibly sadIt's heartbreaking for the relatives to see the person that love melt away in to nothing. Sounds like your mother is a strong and good person. The dude is 93 years old. Inhibitions die with brain cells folks.Go to a nursing home, and there's a good chance you'll see a 93 year old playing with his dick in the middle of the dining room.This isn't some sensational Weinstein scandal. This is H. W. approaching the end of his life. It's just sad.My cousins once had a choir concert in a massive nursing home.  The kids were arranged in the front of this gathering room for the elderly.  While they were singing I noticed this really old lady mean mugging me.  I look back every so often and I swear her eyes never left me.  She slowly gets up and walks over to me where she literally put her face inches from mine.  She just stared into my eyes and eventually slapped the shit out of me.  I was so surprised - and my mom is next to me laughing hysterically.  I was like wtf - and she goes she has dementia.  I was in Appleton, WI recently for Octoberfest, and while I was waiting for my wife to come back from getting some food, an old lady walks right up to me, stares me in the eyes, and flicks me as hard as she could in the forehead. I looked at her stunned and just said "that was rude..." She responded "did that hurt"? I said yes, and she proceeded to flick herself in the forehead, and then walked away. Old people are weird.I keep buttersccotch candies on me at all times just in case I encounter an old person. If you scatter a few on the ground it'll keep them busy long enough for you to get away.They have to stop and count it, but they're really bad at counting.You jest, I know someone who did something similar in reality. Worked retail tech support and a co-worker kept a bag of Werthers stashed to suck up to old ladies. Worked incredibly well. this is brilliantThe real LPT is always in the comments &gt; Go to a nursing home, and there's a good chance you'll see a 93 year old playing with his dick in the middle of the dining room.How about I take your word for it instead?No...you're going to go to a retirement home and you'll wait in their dining room until a 93 year old starts playing with his dick in front of you.  No excuses.But mom I don't want to go to the old folks dinning room again...Hey I could get a good look at a T-bone by sticking my head up a butcher's ass, but I'd rather take the bulls word for it.My grandfather was in a nursing home and one day my dad got called in to speak with the head administrator. Apparently Gramps was playing grab ass and grab titty with the nurses. The setting of the meeting was almost like sitting down in front of a high school principle. There was a large desk with 1 chair on 1 side and 2 chairs on the other. The admin starts telling my dad all of the "bad" things that my grandfather was doing. My dad looks at his dad and asks "Is any of this true?". My grandfathers response was not a yes or a no, or even some kind of excuse. He simply said, "What are they going to do, kick me out?"EDIT - Yeah yeah.... I'm getting all your snide comments. This was back in the early 90's when things were a little different than they are today. When I introduced my new boyfriend to my elderly grandmother, she said, “He can park his shoes next to my bed any day.” I don’t think this behavior is limited to men!😆It most definitely is not. I am a man who works in assisted living. And your anecdote is the G- rated version of my NC-71 life.Dude same here. Some of these women were *smooooth* operators back in the day. Every now and then I'll get a wink and it'll catch me off guard.Must be a handsome young laddie then.Their standards go right out the window the older they get, man. As someone who worked as a male aid at a nursing home, I can say with total confidence that this is 100% true. There were always a few female residents that LOVED it when I was on shower duty. It was kinda gross but what can you do?Have a press conference and tell everyone you were sexual assaulted, apparently.And claim he is as powerful as a President, that's pretty neat.My grandmother once said 'You're too good looking to be a priest' to a priest as she walked into church. I think my mom is still red faced after that.Granted, this is more pg than most examples and she did say worse, I just think it's the funniest thing she said.I'm going to use that line some day lmfaoUnfortunately, dementia can bring down filters people normally have.When I introduced my mother to my boyfriend, who is Indian-American, she said, "You're really hairy." He kind of cracked an uncomfortable smile and nodded. I, on the other hand, knew that wasn't where she would end up."Do you have hair *everywhere*?" MFW.My nan just says weird racist sayings that haven't been a thing since the 50s :(Yeah I had the old guy I was a caregiver for tell me he didn't watch basketball anymore because of all the jigaboos, I didn't even know what he ment.Yeah, the first time I heard that word, I embarrassed the shit out of the racist who said it because I asked, sincerely, what it meant. I was in my 30s. Then he had to explain that basically he was a racist.It is most definitely not limited to men. Some of the things old women have said to me would set your ears on fire.We had one woman in a wheel chair that could barely move but her pinching fingers worked just fine. My ass can testify to that.When my grandfather was on his way out, my gf and I went to visit him a few times. I barely got a chance to talk to him whenever I brought the gf because he spent the entire time hitting on her.   It was kind of hilarious. I have an uncle who does that currently, but he’s only 53 and completely lucid. And does it to you not your GFFirst session of therapy will begin this weekend.MY 93 year old grandpa doesn't even talk to me when we visit... he just fawns all over my girlfriend. I mine as well not be in the room.So, your grandpa knew exactly what he was doing. And did it because he knew he could get away with it. Dude old people do all sorts of shit and get away with it. Lots of old folks are petty thieves, stealing fishermens friends or cans of cat food or starting a war on drugs to target blacks and young people. Uncle LeoI'm an old man! Jerry! Hello!*"Jerry...Hello...Jerry...Hello...Jerry...Hello...WILL SOMEONE ANSWER THAT DAMN PHONE?!"*They did an episode of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on this.Lillian tries to get in trouble like when she was younger but realizes everyone sees her as an innocent old lady and give her a pass for her actions."Those sons of bitches opened a bakery down the street.""You're mad at puppies selling cupcakes?!"Fuck Richard Nixon. That's what I'm saying. I don't know if the guy I was responding to was telling that as a story in agreement to the guy above him, but it sounded like his Gramps knew young people would let him get away with inappropriate behavior. And that's not ok. People without early dementia still know what they are doing.  They just think about it kind of like children do, which is to say not really considering consequences or how it effects others or having much ability to restrain themselves.The human brain is the most complex object in the known universe, and its not an all or nothing thing either.Some parts of the brain may fail before others do. A person may still remain sharp and alert, but their inhibition may go. Other times, a person may lose their memories while still retaining their personality. Every section of the brain has a different specialty. As the brain degrades, some sections will fail before others.Its an unpleasant thing to see, but at the same time it goes give insights into how our brains work.My grandpa got kicked out of his assisted living facility’s hospice ward. His roommate would scream day and night due to his dementia and they did nothing for weeks. They exited my grandpa when they found him on the floor in the morning trying to crawl over to his roommate’s bed. When they asked him what he was doing, he said he was gonna kill him. Gramps was 88 years old, blind and couldn’t walk. Never hurt a fly (after WW2) and is the nicest guy you’ll ever hope to know. Oh and they kept his $100,000 deposit from when he moved in. Motherfuckers.$100k deposit, and you didn't think to hire a lawyer? It's ok it is either exaggerated or made up completelyDude it's just 100k, let it goIf I had $200k for everytime I just left $100k behind...Try r/legaladvice that sounds not legit and if theirs any impropriety put the people who run that place in the poor house. &gt; *He simply said, "What are they going to do, kick me out?"*It's unfortunate your dad did not think to respond with "Dad, do you know what 'In-school suspension' consists of?".Yep, they could kick him out. Nurses are people too, and are required by law to give a set standard of care. If a patients actions prevent them from doing that without placing said nurse in a position that they will be groped, they can remove the patient.EDIT: I was not meaning to imply this is a first step or even a common occurrence, nor is it as applicable with patients who are losing their cognitive functions. I am only referring to the above scenario in which a mentally sound patient is assaulting nurses, who clearly understands it's wrong, and continues to do so simply because he is under the impression there is no recourse. It depends on the facility and a bunch of other variables, but I would argue it is unlikely they would kick him out. Assigning a male as a caregiver, and explaining to female employees that he acts that way is more likely than kicking him out. If that doesn't work they could move him to another location within the facility. From my experience, maneuvering around these issues is common in hospitals/mental health/nursing homes. I know no one reads articles, but this happened 4 years ago. I think your point may still be valid for an 89 year kld. No telling how old he really is as he has yet to produce his long-form birth certificate.Just count his rings.This kills the Bush. My mom worked in a nursing home.  There was always some funny shit going on any time I went to visit her.  One time I walked in and there was a woman in a wheelchair in the hallway outside the doorway of another woman's room.  I just walked in to catch the end of their argument.  The woman in the room shouted, "You can kiss my ass!"  The woman in the wheelchair started rolling away and said, "You're a nasty bitch, a nasty bitch!" over her shoulder.I can’t comment on whether or not this is true or just a scandal, but for your first statement...older folks have a very high rate of contracting STDs (particularly in nursing homes) because A) they are still sexually active (possibly with multiple partners), and B) don’t use condoms because they don’t have a risk of having kids.Eh I'm gonna die in a few years anyway, what's HIV gonna do, kill me?Not only is he 93 yrs old he also immediately admitted it and apologized.  I'm willing to cut this guy a slack burger unlike other people who will remain nameless who won't apologize and don't have the age excuse. But I've done nothing wrong!Username checks the fuck outBut he didn't admit to any sort of sexual assault&gt;A representative for Bush, now 93, said that the former president might have erred in his “attempt at humor.” &gt;“President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind," the Bush spokesman said in a statement to Fox News. FWIW I'm with OP, this was an 89 year old man in a wheelchair who can barely raise his arms. This isn't Harvey Weinstein. The article linked doesn't say he admitted and apologized at all? It says his representatives didn't respond to request for comment. Did you get that from a different article?My friend work in a psych ward and often time old people with dimentia are out there when rooms are full in the seniors ward. She sees 90+ year old dicks all day every day. She's even caught 80 year old trying to bang in the cleaning closets. I just had this discussion with my wife. Sexual assault is becoming so ambiguous and overused that its going to go full circle and become a joke again.Each incidence of sexual assault/harassment is totally different and should be treated as such:James Toback - Creep who uses his position to try to convince people to sleep with him.Bill Cosby - Sexual predator who drugs peopleG.H.W. Bush - Senile old man who tells nasty jokesHarvey Weinstein - Sexual predator who forces himself on people2 of the guys above belong in jail. 1 of them should be essentially excused/ignored. 1 of them should be shunned/turned down.edit - I did not read many of the Toback accounts that are being brought up. If true that he would not allow women to leave or masturbated onto them without permission, then he moves into the rapist category.Even the terms "harassment" and "assault" are being used interchangeably now.  It's disrespectful to assault survivors, and as you pointed out, likely to eventually have the opposite effect it's intended to.&gt;I just had this discussion with my wife. Sexual assault is becoming so ambiguous and overused that its going to go full circle and become a joke again.&lt;This is what worries me about using words like: racist, white supremacist, Nazi, rapist, etc to describe things that are less severe than those descriptions used to entail. The words lose their impact. When someone says "That is a rapist" or "That is a white supremacist" it needs to mean what those words have meant since their inception, not a "modern" interpretation. Dirty old man telling bad dirty jokes at an inappropriate time? Not a rapist. Dosing women so you can fuck them while they are asleep? Rapist. Question whether it makes sense to have all white people leave a campus so folks of color can a day alone? Not racist. (Well, asking people to leave is racist but that's a different bag of cats.) Marching with torches shouting "Jews will not replace us!"? Racist. Not hard. A little thicker skin, some common sense, and a sense of humor will go a long way. Right? I'm kind of a a lefty and all, but we are getting carried away. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest or something. It's a big world; sometimes it's unpleasant. That's okay. Save the outrage for things that are outrageous.Even if you are a "lefty" it should be *particularly* important to be clear about the definitions of these words, because they must be taken seriously. So, rather than giving more reason to be lax about usage of these terms, being leftist means we must be *more* careful about them, or else we can't call it out when it happens.Can't wait til the dirt on Jesus Christ comes out...He is a socialist hobo from the middle east and wants to take your wealth and give it to the poor. He also wants to spread his middle eastern belief of the one true god. The dude can turn water into wine. Do you think he's of sound mind?Where do I go to tell my victimization story of all the old ladies my grandmom used to hang out with who would pinch my cheeks and grab my ass when I was a ripped teenager?/r/TwoXChromosomes Well I tried it turns out “I’m a piece of shit” and  “part of the problem”You are now banned from/r/offmychest/r/TwoXChromosomes/r/RapeI got banned from 2X for offering to purchase a new door knob on Amazon for an OP who was, in fact, scared of a roommate and angry they didn't have a lock for their bedroom door.  "Reported for intimidation and victim blaming"  That sub is an all-female victim factory.You should've thought better of trying to help someone help themself.Hey, I know that feeling. I got chewed out in college once because an acquaintance said she was worried about walking home from campus by herself, and I offered to walk her home or buy her pepper spray and she said that was a misogynistic attitude because the real solution is to make the world a place where she wouldn't have to be nervous about walking home alone.I mean, Jesus, yeah, but holding that ideal isn't going to help you out right here, right now.And /r/relationshipsGot randomly banned from there a few months ago. Got a bot response.Well, that didn't take long.The man's 93 years old. He *was* 89 years old at the time. He's been in a wheelchair, and has barely had motor function for the past 6-8 years. Biden has to be shitting himself right about now.Dammit, thank you. I looked through this entire thread looking for this comment, I even made my own. They should really create some kind of spectrum regarding all this harassment shit. Right now having made an inappropriate joke about a girl once or been young, dumb and drunk copping a feel one time 12 years ago will put you in the same category as Mr weinstein himself. Not trying to justify this behavior at all but some cases should be regarded a little bit less horrendous than others. It's like pissing in public and being branded a sexual predator. Should you have pissed in public? Probably not. Is being marked as one of society's most vile and base members, essentially barring you from access to most jobs and socially marginalizing you for your entire life adequate punishment? Probably not either.I got caught pissing in public when I was 16 after a party. The cops just called my parents and had them pick me up, even though I was not cooperating and being a drunk asshole. I’m now so grateful that’s all they decided to do. Seriously don't think this rises to the same level as some of the other guys in the news lately.Yeah. Kinda a mis-use of the term "sexual assault"People will say "that doesnt mean we should just igbore this level of stuff"  But even still, this isnt even bad.The man has vascular parkinsonism. Being a form of Parkinson's, which itself is a form of dementia, Bush is losing his capacity for rational thought as well as inhibition. In other words, he is becoming very much like a child in what his mind deems is appropriate behavior.Edit: My wife is a nurse, started as a CNA a decade ago, and has been groped , hit on, had penises whipped out and played with in front of her, and pretty much any sexually explicit behavior you can imagine, all at retirement homes. You can't hold people with these issues to the same expectations as the mentally healthy.Whoever is downvoting me, fuck you. Do some research on degenerative brain diseases, and the behavior of those suffering from them. This situation is the fault of Bush's handlers, as his doctors would have made them fully aware of his issues.Thank you.  Too many people out there looking for blood instead of trying to understand science.For Pete's Sake.  He's 93.  We're luck he's wearing pants.  Leave the guy alone and stop trying to further your career by jumping on this issue.  He probably thought your butt was a ham sammich.I wonder how much of this is due to the fact that he's in a wheelchair and not standing. His public political instincts practiced over decades include reaching over and putting a hand on the back or shoulder of the person next to him when the camera comes out. But now he's in a sitting position and he reaches over, brushes her keister by mistake, realizes what he's done so he makes a silly joke to ease the awkwardness (coming from an 89-year-old man, who could possibly think he had serious harassment intentions?), then pats her again as a finisher to the joke. A normal person who wasn't looking to grandstand and cash in would chuckle, knowing that they now have an awesome story to tell at parties for the rest of their life.This actress sounds like a hell of a victim.EDIT: Sorry, but choosing a 93 year old former president who is literally stuck in a wheelchair as your hill to die on is a really strange decision. Her statement is peppered with extremely vitriolic political commentary, and she randomly thanks Barack Obama at the end for not really any reason. She says "touched me from behind his wheelchair". She then says "touched me again". Touched her where? Was this a case of a 100 year old man with Parkinson's clumsily touching her leg because it was hand-level with him? Or was he deliberately giving her the 'ol Luke Duke?Well that's scraping the fucking bottom of the barrel to find your very own personal sexual assault story so you don't feel left out.What is going on in the world?People are too desperate for individuality. This is bullshit.I am not a huge fan of his politically but my God. The straws these people grab at are amazing, it actually detracts from real issues like Weinstein.Disgusting.Barely relevant actress stretches definition of sexual assault to its breaking point to jump on the bandwagon for some exposure. Me(want that payday)Too I guess.I believe her, but if he didn't act like this when he was young and powerful, and I have no reason to believe he did, I'll chalk it up to senility and diminished capacity.By all accounts, the Bush family were all nice people. Maybe not good presidents, but every account idicates they aren't evil people. ... in 2014.What is she hoping to accomplish with this? It was 3 years ago and there's no evidence he touched her butt. The dude's 93 and you're accusing him of touching your butt 3 years ago. I smell an attention whore.&gt; What is she hoping to accomplish with this?Her show on AMC just ended and she's not well known.  I think I have an idea what she's wants to accomplish... :)She pretty clearly decided to jump on after the Weinstein stuff too. She knows exactly what she is doing. Bullshit, nonsense like this is making real victims of sexual assault less likely to be believed. She's just jumping on the bandwagon and looking for attention.I slowly watched his arm old arm move towards me... I couldn't do anything... overpowered me, I couldn't run away from him in that wheelchair.This is a load of bullshit, this nobody smelled money and a favorable public opinion in the aftermath of Weinstein and is going after a 93 year old man in a wheelchair. I wouldn't believe it even if it was just a regular old man, let alone a former President of the United States... This is ridiculous. She is so brave! A 90+ year old man touched you (if true) and she was hiding it and now with all these brave women (who were actually assaulted) she comes out? Guess these guys were smarter than we thought...http://thechive.com/2010/12/09/when-your-just-a-huge-pussy-try-hoverhands-17-photos/This was during a photo shoot. Provide photos of the incident and we will all believe you and bring the hammer down. But this seems ridiculous.I hate being that person because the culture of sexual assault is so terrible for so many people. But this seems like a little known person trying to grab attention by jumping on the #metoo bandwagon.Edit: The 6th Amendment in the Bill of Rights provides us with the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court of public opinion should be the same. Blindly believing everyone is damaging to preventing future cases of sexual assault. If any one of you were accused of any crime, I would treat you equally.Photo from the shoot.http://cdn3.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2014/03/turnhouston_007.jpgThis is what sexual assault looks like.Are you happy now shitlords?  This is what it has come to!  Looks to me like he was trying to put his arm around her for the photo. No intelligent person would grope someone in front of a camera. I don't mean to victim-blame here. Sexual assault/harassment should be taken seriously. But my first instinct is that it was a misunderstanding brought about by his friendliness mixed with his currently limited physical abilities.&gt; This was during a photo shoot. Provide photos of the incident and we will all believe you and bring the hammer down. The dude is 93 years old. I don't think anyone is going to bring the hammer down on this. maybe not in court, but someone apparently wants to run his name through the mud again before he finally kicks it. She just wants her name out there. It has nothing to do with him.Ok, its beginning to get a little ridiculous.This really pisses me off. I'm all for taking down the douchecanoes, but George HW Bush was in his nineties when she met him, and he'd already suffered *a series of strokes* that put him in the wheelchair. His cognitive function has been affected, he's declined mentally, and she speaks out against him 4 years later just to get press. It's fucking despicable.This is ridiculous. I hate our society sometimes.
&gt;Paddock is believed to have removed the hard drive before fatally shooting himself    Oh good, that will help refute the conspiracy theory that he shot himself and then his ghost removed evidence and flew away with it.  Well thats just a stupid theory. Everyone knows ghosts use public transit. It's true.He could have throw the hard drive out the window into Las Vegas Blvd.  He's no Cam Newton. I was at Mandalay Bay last week.  It's not a far throw.  Any able bodied adult could do it.OP is making a joke aboit Cam Newton throwing a stolen laptop out of his dorm room window. It resulted in him getting kicked out of Florida and then transfering to Auburn If he threw it like Cam Newton it'd likely get intercepted by the policeOooohhh yeah.   I had forgotten all about that.  Did you ever see the almost brilliant non-answer he gave during an ESPN (I think) interview when asked about the incident? It's hilarious, I'll see if I can find it Please do. Id love to see ithttp://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=13004820I'm pretty sure this is the one, but I'll have to watch it later Or it could have been a modern chip drive and he just flushed itYeah, those are really small and easily breakable.&gt; Modern chip driveEducated word choice.Okay a Modern PCI-E chip hard drive. PCI-E SSD card is what you are trying to say. The word “hard” is generally only used referencing disk drives with moving parts.the hard comes from hard disks, to employ the distinction from floppy disks of the previous iteration.So yeah, if people get the term "hard disk drive" they'd learn the term "solid state drives", to employ the distinction that nothing is physically moving in the... hang on, there isn't a discus to speak of... nothing is being physically driven to spin...screw it. storage.It's possible his computer never had a hard drive and he ran an OS of a [thumb drive](http://uk.pcmag.com/operating-systems-and-platforms/88253/feature/how-to-run-windows-10-from-a-usb-drive).This is a common belief among the ancient Egyptians - when their soul began the journey to the afterlife, they believed they would carry their internet search history with it, which is why they were buried with computers and other devices.We don't know if they had access to their search history in their afterlife (academia is not concerned with that), but we do know a lot more about ancient Egyptians and their porn habits thanks to this custom.Theyve recently found a mummy with a usb stick around his neck. You know what was on it? Your joke. [deleted]"Investigators find melted hard drive in incinerator after shooters body cremated."  Its like he just wanted to be always know by all the conspiracy forums in the Internet. First good theory I've seen Does nothing for the conspiracy theory that he wasn't alone in the hotel room.Thanks for that laugh.The interesting part here is that law enforcement is going to invariably move further away from "traditional" policing and rely more heavily on digital footprints.  When someone doesn't have a sizable digital footprint, they'll be at a loss to investigate, and they'll try more and more to profile people without major digital presences.  ^HooorayYou might even be suspicious if you don't have a social media presence. This is gonna be ^fuuun!Isnt this happening in the corporate wirld already?Yep, and as we all know corporations are how we should model our nation. USA USAI applied to a law enforcement job, I have no social media presence and because of that they gave me extra attention. They finally asked me why and I answered with a question(big no no), "how happy is your significant other when a random chick like or comments in your profile?" The both grinned knowing what I was talking about and I just said to them "for 5 years I haven't had that problem and it gives us time to fight about real things like whole milk or 1%." That took care of any extra attention I was given, before anyone asks I got DQ'd for being color blind.And in your place they hired somebody that was worse than you in every regard except for their ability to see colors.I'm going back to school for engineering in the spring, had I known I was color blind from the start I wouldn't have ever tried, w.e. thats life.Security services already find that suspicious. Someone who you think might be a spy with no or minimal social media presence? Thats interesting.I wonder if they'll ever require people to register themselves in order to access the internet. They then register people from the time they are born in case someone doesn't want to China [already](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/china-doubles-down-on-real-name-registration-laws-forbidding-anonymous-online-posts/) does this.This sicko really thought things through unfortunatelyWhat would be the point in removing it though?  He wasn't planning on leaving alive anyway.Maybe to shelter other people? Just because he shot at a crowd of people doesn't mean there isn't someone or some group that he cares about.  It is odd, though, that he'd chose to do this when it's easy as balls to make the data irrecoverable in a hurry with a gun.i mean lanza did the same thing, he killed his mom and he was a shut in hermit Ya, fair enough.  Either way, people will never buy any of this or any other evidence one way or another.  They could release the video of him streaming the shooting that apparently exists and they still wouldn't believe it.Actually, considering the lack of images of him released so far, that is probably the one piece of evidence that would make the story gel. Otherwise, as of now, it's all so nebulous. The silence and bizarre characteristics of the investigation and news coverage has left the whole ordeal shrouded in an unsettling mysterious glaze.Everything that gets investigated looks super mysterious. Even if it's completely straightforward the details of an investigation look weird because people are weird, especially people committing crimes. My desk right now has a bunch of gum wrappers but no gum because I leave with the gum still in my mouth and throw it out later and am a slob. That would look mysterious. I have some paper with a bunch of cryptic scribbles and random words because I use the same paper to jot down tons of notes. True enough. :)&gt;The silence and bizarre characteristics of the investigation and news coverage has left the whole ordeal shrouded in an unsettling mysterious glaze. I live in LV and while I don't consider myself much of a conspiracy theorist, something about this whole thing feels "off" to me. Normally there's a lot of discussion in the national media about motives in a mass shooting. Months and months of follow up reporting with new information. Then this shooting happens, and I feel like that type of coverage is extremely muted in comparison. Then there's the ever shifting timeline/location of the security guard Jesus Campos. And he shows up on Ellen with some kind of handler when he's interviewed? I'm not going to be jumping to the "It was the Secret Society of CIA Lizard Jews" type conclusions. But I feel like there's some dishonesty going on in reporting this incident and I don't know why. Wait, Paddock live streamed his rampage?Allegedly.  I've never seen footage of it and i've never seen anyone post anything about it, but i think one of the first reports said he was filming and streaming it.People heard he had cameras so they assume he either captured video or streamed it. Beyond that I haven't seen any proof that it exists. It's just people making assumptions and leaps of logic. Unless there is more information that I did not hear.i thought the cameras were there so he could watch the hallways.So he filmed himself the whole time during the rampage, and apparently didn't say a word to the cameras about his motivation for what he was doing? That sort of stretches the imagination.I'm saying nobody knows if he actually filmed himself at all. Doubt it. Release the video(s) and let people decide. Instead they’re telling people what to decide by not releasing the video(s).you clearly haven't visited r/conspiracy lately...every video of every shooting ever is fake to them.  Every. Single. One.Just out of curiosity, what videos are you talking about? I can't think of a single mass shooting where I've seen video footage of the shooter in the act. to your point, we don't tend to have live action video of most of these events, but we often have immediate aftermath video and they claim it is all fake and staged every single time.  Name any national tragedy and there will be 20 threads "proving" the entire thing is fake.  Sandy Hook, Boston bombing, etc etc etc etcThere's bits and pieces from Columbine, Colorado springs. Hell even the JFL assassination if you're talking about shootings conspiracy theorist are crazy about.Never forget the Junior Football League assassinationNot the Muslim ones Whenever the shooter is white the conspiracy is always thrown out there that it was really done by muslims and they framed the white guy. Never fails.We did that with the moon landing. People still claimed it was fake.The only positive thing to come out of that conspiracy was when Buzz Aldrin re-arranged Bart Sibrel's face for accusing him of it on video.  Classic.  The entire Apollo project was however just a dick measuring contest with the Russians.  Many decades and a nice mattress I can finally sleep on later the contest continues. Fire, and some magnesium would work better, and is also quick.Why would it work "better"? A bullet through the platter makes the data unrecoverable.Actually, you'd be surprised at how much data they can recover from damaged hard drives. Even tiny fragments can be read with the right equipment. https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/12/04/destroying-information-hard-drive-isnt-easy/76785790/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/how-to/a8566/how-to-read-a-smashed-hard-drive-14877558/The best way to get rid of data is to overwrite it multiple times with random bits. That or completely destroy the hard drive with chemicals, heat, or powerful magnetselectron microscope can recover bits that have been written over multiple times. There's a reason the DOD will use 35 passes and then toss it into industrial shredderswhy not just throw it in the trash? It's not like the gov is going to sift through metric fuck tons of garbage in the hopes of finding one lunatic's hard drive. It's not like he was a mastermind of some global conspiracy, he's one nut. Edit: I'm dumb. I didn't realize he had the HD on his person during the attack. So I guess he was trying to hide something. But I still think that for the everyday normal dude who isn't about to do something terrible, wiping your drive and recycling it is normal, smashing it to bits is just overkill. No one wants to go through Vegas trash. They might.  They reconstruct shredded documents which seems just as ridiculous to me - https://www.shredone.com/blog/shredded-document-reconstructionYeah but they take that from a home or a business.  I really doubt they're stopping all municipal trash for a week in the hopes of finding the ONE bag of shit they hope to find. I mean sure maybe they would do that if there was a sincere clear and present national security issue that this said bag of shit could solve, but in this case (and most cases) I highly doubt it. Fair enough, I can buy that.Easier to toss it into a microwave oven on high.That was my first thought. (calling /r/MrRobot) Didn't have one in the hotel room, maybe. Even shitty motel 6 rooms have a microwave in them, I'm sure a Vegas suite had one.You can't be sure that the all the data will be unrecoverable. Unless you shred it, or at least that's how the people in data security I've spoken to have said. The government is the only group I can think of were this would really matter, but that's the group we are talking about in this case. A pile of molten metal is impossible to "fix".Most modern platters that I've come across are glass or ceramic with a metal coating, so the bullet would reduce it to a pile of fragments. Sure, some fragments *might* be readable if you took the time to figure out the alignment of the tracks and blocks, but that's extremely difficult and still might not work.I used to destroy hard drives for part of my living. Granted these are datacenter-grade drives, but I never heard one make a sound like broken glass or ceramic, and I did horrible things to these drives.Edit: apparently modern LAPTOP drives have glass platters, while modern desktop disks are aluminum. Seems counterintuitive to me. Okay Heisenberg When people are willing to spend any amount of money recovering off HDs the only data made irrecoverable by the bullet is the parts the bullet goes through.&gt; Maybe to shelter other people?Perhaps he was a pedo who thought we would be revealed soon so he decided to go crazy.I think it is the additional torture of committing a mass murder and taunting everyone with absolutely no clues or motives. It's working.That's true.I'm not a criminal, and even I would probably destroy my laptop if I was about to commit suicide. I wouldn't want people to find my stash of porn with Japanese gangbangs and bukakkes and all of that shit.They did just arrest his brother for kiddie porn.Where's the fun in that?&gt; Japanese gangbangs and bukakkesA friend want's to know if you will share.If your friend doesn't know how to find it on his own, he has a lot to learn. Poor guy. Finding porn and clearing your browsing history should be part of the 8th grade curriculum for all males.I will let him know. Also, just use incognito.Incorrect he had planned to escape as far as I'm aware, source below. *The gunman who killed 58 people in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history targeted aviation fuel tanks, stockpiled his car with explosives and had personal protection gear as part of an escape plan, the Clark County sheriff said Monday.*So maybe we he figured out/decided he wasn't getting out alive he decided to destroy the laptop. I really struggle to see how he could have thought he'd get away. I guess that tells you a lot about his mental state. Also kinda supports the idea that he had someone managing him.lanza did this as well Maybe he believed there was some chance he would get away or that he would change his mind and didn't want evidence readily available.&gt; He wasn't planning on leaving alive anywayyou dont know that Cops said he planned on leaving the room alive. It's in their press conference. They never explained how they knew. Doesn't mean he wasn't concerned about his legacy. That's a motivating factor for a lot of mass shooters. Why did the Malaysian airline pilot crash his plane into the most desolate area of the ocean?Because thats what was under himMaybe he Googled stuff he doesn't want people to know about, like if he had an STD or something like that.Or maybe he doesn't want to drag innocent people down with him, like if he emailed friends and stuff that had nothing to do with this.Because to these sickos it's all about going down in history... they don't want the police to search the HD and find out they were really into kiddy porn.... that would tarnish their "bad ass" reputation.... Joke's on him. His brother was just arrested for child pornography. He's dead so I'm not sure he'll get the joke.He planted the hard drive on his broI mean, i get what you're saying but there isn't any evidence that he was involved in child pornography in any way.  My brother is a vegan, that doesn't mean i am.I had heard he had plans to escape. Has that been debunked?I don't know if anything is proven, but according to other people he had body armour and some kind of escape plans.  Not sure if body armour really means escape, it might just mean he didn't want to get taken out from the ground too soon.&gt; according to other people According to the police themselves, they said so in a press conference. I think it was uncovered he did plan to leave as he had a get away car.Or it was removed by other parties, accomplices or even law enforcement (or accomplices that are law enforcement). Who knows. We never will. Just another lone nutso who appeared out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly, with no rational explanations offered.A fantastically wealthy lone nutso with ties to the Philippines and a crazy family. It's really the perfect storm for conspiracy theories, especially with how badly bungled the investigation looks.You couldn't make a better conspiracy plot in a lab.[Did you see that his house was also broken into after the shooting?](https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/intruders-entered-stephen-paddocks-house-in-reno-police-say/)Thrillseekers? Burglars? Or... co-conspirators removing hidden evidence?Yeah, conspiracy food, for sure.it's a lot easier to take the whole laptop like the Casimir effect?  Kinda makes sense.  "Paddock had settled any debts he had with casinos shortly before the attack"  So he was a Lannister, then?Depends. Was he fucking his sister?Possibly. That is a weird family.

Search the area?I will bet he slipped it into the garbage somewhere outside his room, before he started.What the hell? I am the furthest thing from a conspiracy theorist.... but this seems so fishy.nah, it is pretty basic if you wanted to cover your tracks. Gun purchases, internet searches, etc. We already knew he put in the work to erase it. So a scrub and dispose isn't at all out of character&gt; Investigators digging into Paddock’s background also learned he purchased software designed to erase files from a hard drive, but without the hard drive to examine it is impossible to know if he ever used the software, one source said.DBAN is free, yo. The killingspreeprotip is always in the comments. Perhaps, but not extraordinarily so. The Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois, and Sandy Hook school shooters all did the same. Sounds like they all read the same FBI manual after they got recruited.Oh, snap!But why did he bring it to the hotel room with him? And where did it go?He was in that room for a few days, I imagine he was using it. As for where it went your guess is as good as mine.He could have tossed it before getting to the hotel and run on a live CD/usb drive and then disposed of those very easily before starting his rampage.If you were going to kill people and you wanted to be remember, but not as the weird freak you really were, wouldn't you remove your harddrive?  He was a overly creepy private guy, he knew they would come to his house, also the police think he wanted to survive the shooting.  The article says Cho Seung Hui did the same, and even Adam Lanza pulled out his hard drive and destroyed it.It's only two screws to remove, at least on my laptop.  However can't they get his website history from his ISP?&gt; However can't they get his website history from his ISP?Not if he used the hotel WiFi.  They *might* have logs, but even if so, it could be trivial to get around for someone who did as much planning as he did.Why is this fishy? He likely did it himself, as the article stated. Kind of off topic but I hate that "conspiracy theorist" is such a negative term nowadays.  I mean, it's *bad* to question the "official" line on things?  Especially when the story's full of holes?Its bad to assert things as true that you dont have evidence to back up. If you claim there must be a second shooter, fuck you conspiracy theorist. Prove it or gtfo. If you claim it was a flase flag, fuck you conspiracy theorist. Prove it or gtfo. I'm not challenging that, it's just that there are a ton of unanswered questions with the whole Vegas scenario and I hate that people who are skeptical abput the official line on things are dismissed for being crazy/stupid/racist etc.He probably took it out before he was going to do it. &gt; furthest thing from a conspiracy theoristWhat does this mean? I don't think anyone here understands what "conspiracy theory" really means.Look at 9/11 - the media/white house version is that it was a conspiracy of islamic extremists but there are lots of unanswered questions and missing evidence to actually prove exactly what happened. So no matter WHAT you believe, you're a conspiracy theorist. I think what you people mean to do is equate "conspiracy theorist" with "doesn't trust the media/government" and then try to act like that's such a bad thing? At best it's useful idiocy at worst it's an active attempt at suppressing critical thinking and intellectual independence. Yes, there are wacko crazy conspiracies out there like flat earth and even the legitimate, suspicious topics have plenty of people that take it *wayyy* too far, but people really need to stop acting like if you don't believe John on KCYV Channel 12's version of the story then you're a loony neckbeard. Governments are trustworthy. The media has no reason to lie. The police are here to help you. Just trust me and this will all be much easier. But PLEASE watch my shitty YouTube video and read my WordPress.com blog though 🙄 Those are the real trufs! Every significant event is a false flag, everything the media reports is a lie, and people on YouTube are way more reliable than the mainstream media.I, too, dislike how the term "conspiracy theorists" is often used to describe what would more accurately be described as "incompetent theorists". The problem with the stereotypical irrational "conspiracy theorist" isn't the conspiracy part, it's the irrational part. There are rational people who theorize rationally about conspiracies, and there are also irrational people who are convinced for irrational reasons that mainstream, "official" narratives are correct.On the other hand, I wouldn't be so quick to assume that u/McLovin1019 was trying to, like you put it:&gt;equate "conspiracy theorist" with "doesn't trust the media/government" and then try to act like that's such a bad thingUnfortunately, the term "conspiracy theorist", even though it's inaccurate, has entered the common lexicon as a standard way to refer to a certain type of incompetent theorist. I think that many people use it without thinking that there is anything in principle wrong with theorizing about conspiracies or about questioning mainstream narratives.That's because it is fishy. Don't worry about labels. It's ok to ask questions. This whole thing has been fishy from day 1. Actually, it's been pretty straight forward. So there was some confusion about the timeline which resolved itself but otherwise there's not much to it, unless you make it something it's not.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCl0K9kCZ2wtwo suicide shots twenty seconds apart.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR_ubbgIXLEmultiple gunfire types in unison can be heard, as well as some close shots and some which are much further away, too far apart to be an echo by any stretch. Or how about how fucking terrified this guy was this conference when he had to defend the timeline and say "there is no conspiracy you guys!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOdPK0Qgv8&amp;t=3sWhy did ISIS claim the attack when they have a relatively [impeccable record by all official accounts](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/isis-amaq-las-vegas/541746/) when it comes to claiming attacks?Not really[deleted]I somehow doubt this was what happened. Paddock wasn't that computer literate by any accounts. He could just have popped the drive out and lobbed it out the window. He made his living off of playing statistics of video poker machines and real estate. The intricacies of Windows and a lap top aren't that difficult.Yet he didn't realize that shooting a rifle at jet fuel wouldn't make it ignite.Obviously not a Mythbusters fan. There were two bullet holes in them, zero evidence it wasn't just from spraying. Using those shitty stocks and standing on a sofa, he was lucky not to shoot the lights out in his room. Or his kneecaps off.so who does a suicidal gunman want to protect? I'm surprised he "removed" the hard drive. Why not just put a few dozen rounds into the thing?It's difficult to get data off a physically shattered hard drive platter, but it's certainly possible, even for government agencies.Oh, I remember HDD purge day in the Army. Used a hammer to destroy them before they were sent off for further destruction.If you’re getting rid of an HD, you burn it. Fuck how are they gonna arrest him now?I'm amazed at how many people actually still believe the official narrative.   [deleted]&gt; Why not just ask the NSA what he was doing?&gt; How do we know it wasn't state-sponsored?Did you even think before you hit the keys?If they used it then it would be an admission that they're still doing it. Seriously though, defund it.i want the truth, I feel bad for all the people that are taking this shooting at face value. Jesus Campos is not even a registered security guard in nevada. The public deserves to know the truth.The truth might be that he booted it up from a USB and the laptop didn't even have a hard drive with how he was using it.Or it magically disappeared to get rid of evidence He removed the hard drive and then what did he do with it?Maybe he did it to prove that motive is bullshit.Inception Motive, I like it....You guys do realize that he could have removed the hard drive at another location, right? The article did not say that he brought the laptop with the hard drive installed into the hotel room only to make it vanish.Jeez.Or brought it with him and got rid of it during the week he stayed there.Yup. I guess my main point was it didn’t have to be mid shooting. Why bring a laptop without a hard drive?? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CDWhy shoot up a concert?That's a false equivalency, his other actions before the shooting seem to be at least rational, albeit evil.  Moving a non-working laptop around doesn't make sense.How was he watching the cameras without the hard drive?If he took it out before killing himself, where is the hard drive? We're tools recovered that indicated he personally removed it?are we to believe he blinded himself and willingly gave up all view of the hallway outside his room in order to make all the victims live in confusion?Probably had child porn on it. god damnit, the conspiracy theorists are going to go nuts over this.come on LVPD, get your shit together.Their "shit" is together.  The conspiracy theorists were concocting theories *within 30 minutes of the shooting*.    No matter what is found or not found, they will spin it.  When authorities can't or won't answer questions, it's because they are hiding.  If they answer the questions, they are lying.  There is no shutting these people up.  There is only ignoring them.You know what my conspiracy theory is?  My theory is that the conspiracy theorists who makes these video and publish the books don't actually believe their own theory.  They just know they will attract attention and maybe make them some money or a name for themselves.I don't know what people hope to accomplish when they criticize the investigators in these situations.  If the shooter ditched his hard drive, what do you expect the police to do?  Sift through every trashcan, storm drain, and landfill in the LV area?  What are you hoping they find on it?  Let's say the hard drive turns up and the shooter left a document on it explaining why he did it.  Would that make it better?  Is there any combination of words in the English language that if the shooter wrote them down would make the shooting acceptable and understandable?Consider the case of the Unabomber.  He is still alive.  He has been interviewed.  His manifesto was published in major newspapers.  We know absoutely everything about how and why he bombed all those people  And so what?  Does that make what he did more understandable?  Nope. People do these things because they are broken, miserable assholes.&gt; come on LVPD, get your shit together.what have they done wrong How about jumble up the timeline for startersWell there was the whole 2pac caseThey suspect paddock himself removed it. Right in the article.Of course they do, who else would they suspect?  That doesn't mean it actually was him though.  Wasn't his laptop used to stream ~~the shooting~~ *the cameras he had set up in the hallway and peep hole*?  If that's the case and it was him who removed it, then it's either in the hotel room or on the ground in pieces below his window somewhere.    I think this piecemeal information is fueling conspiracies that probably aren't true but based on the bits and pieces we have, a conspiracy is the only thing that makes sense at this point.  They need to just keep the information to themselves or release all of it if they want to keep these theories to a minimum.    Edit:  Fixed a detail.  Since when do we know his laptop streamed the shooting?They did not say he streamed the shooting.  They said he had cameras in the hallway so logically he needed a way to see them.  He likely used it for that purpose.  He was streaming the shooting? I missed that part...&gt; Of course they do, who else would they suspect?"*We suspect that one of our own removed the hard drive, because Paddock had some really sweet porn on there.  We've been sharing it around the office for a little while now, and have turned the evidence room into a bit of a home-theatre.  We make the rookies clean up afterwards...*"
&gt; Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, based with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before her jump.I hope they have more proof/evidence than "allegedly" claiming he did. The media have to use the term allegedly. The prosecution will say that she actually did it.I mean, evil man killed his wife, that's all you need to think.Or you could read the article.&gt; Physiotherapist Mrs Cilliers said the chances of a main parachute failing was one in 750 jumps but for the reserve to fail as well was "one-in-a-million".Innumeracy in action. If the chance of one failure is 1 in 750, and the first chute has already failed, then the chance of a second failure is . . .?Bingo! 1 in 750!And the *a priori* chance of both chutes failing is . . .?1/750 x 1/750 = 1/562,500Which is not one in a million.Of course, if both chutes were packed by the same idiot with the same packing flaw, then the chance that both chutes fail is very high indeed.

It already has a positive disposition towards the wealthy and powerful, major strides indeedThis seems more like a Disney animatronics moment than a Wright Brothers one. There isn't really anything new here, besides some promotion from the Saudi government.No? So you've seen a lot of robots who pair facial expressions with responses? https://youtu.be/DHyUYg8X31cI've seen this argument, and infact this very clip in response to robot rights.  The simple answer is this, It's not for me to make a judgement in what level of AI deserves rights.  If you ask for my opinion I would say when they reach a level of self awareness that is not pre-programmed.  When AI becomes a reality there will need to be new laws created.  My expectation is they deserve the same rights as pets.  A beloved status, some protection against their misuse, but ultimately when they cease to function they are destroyed.  Something I'm trying to figure out is this robot aware enough to ask for rights?I don't think so.  I think it's mostly preprogrammed responses to questions that it uses to communicate.  It can probably organize those responses to give the appearance of intelligence but at this moment it seems like it's working from a database. And it's a girl robot.

such a longish article--I think I will print it out and read it after supper. Well if you ever manage to get through the extensive length of that article and still want to read more....https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1CV3CMProbably not after this news from Amazon: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/78ybjb/amazon_has_received_approval_for_wholesale/I’m not clear on what you’re thinking.  It looks to me like CVS is trying to diversify and get more into medical insurance.  Amazon is trying to enter the mail order pharmacy market (and compete against CVS).   So the CVS deal could also be considered as a defensive action against Amazon moving into the pharmacy market.Why would it affect the CVS deal? The amazon news came out first. They look like they came out at about the same time; the amazon news came from a St Louis Dispatch article that was released an hour ago. Either way, presumably CVS began pursuing Aetna before knowing of Amazon's interest.Amazon’s interest in the pharmacy space has been well known since at least August. The articles are out there — it isn’t new news. I’m just not understanding how the Amazon announcement in any way affects the possible CVS/Aetna deal. It is more likely that CVS is trying to strengthen their position as a response to changes in the market (Amazon’s  expansion being one).
Did she not menstruate for 9 months and just think nothing of it? Some women hit menopause at 45...so maybe she thought she was done having kids. But Believe me after having two kids I sure the hell would know if something was growing in me. Before a woman goes through menopause,  her periods can become very irregular. You go  for months without it, then it returns. At 45, this lady  probably thought she was pre-menopausal when she didn't get her period for all those months..my former sister-in-law did not look like she was pregnant even at the 8-month mark.  she was about 5'5" and 150 pounds at the time.  She even wore her bikini at the beach.  Nobody outside of the family knew she was pregnant with such a flat stomach. (flatter than mine, even)
You can't force a grown woman who has spent half her life fighting mental illness to keep fighting a fight **she** believes is lost. Let them have the dignity of choice, it's humane.someone who has "mental illness" wouldnt be in the right "mind" to decide if he or she wants to "die.&gt; GHENT, Belgium (AP) — After struggling with mental illness for years, Cornelia Geerts was so desperate to die that she asked her psychiatrist to kill her.&gt; &gt; Her sister worried that her judgment was compromised. The 59-year-old was taking more than 20 pills every day, including antidepressants, an opioid, a tranquilizer, and two medicines often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.&gt; &gt; But about a year later, on October 7, 2014, her doctor administered a lethal dose of drugs — a legal procedure in Belgium, which has among the world’s most permissive euthanasia laws.&gt; &gt; “I know it was Cornelia’s wish, but I said to the psychiatrist that it was a shame that someone in treatment for years could just be brought to the other side with a simple injection,” said her sister, Adriana Geerts.Not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, people should have ultimate control over their lives. On the other hand, people who are mentally ill are generally seeing a distorted view of reality, and are not always in the right mind to make this decision.I'm mentally ill and have to deal with constant suicidal thoughts, the normal stresses of life, and condescending comments from people who say I can't make decisions about my life because I see a distorted view of reality.  The same people who say those things think you can simply talk to a therapist or pop some pills and everything is fixed.  The real problem with all of this is we force suicidal people to jump off buildings or shoot themselves instead of allowing them humane exit options.I'm also torn on this. I've suffered from depression for most of my life and was diagnosed bipolar about 4 years ago. There are times when I absolutely cannot take any more of being at war with myself.I guess it boils down to how you can never know how much someone is suffering and we don't really have the right to tell someone they need to carry a weight that they can't carry any more.As someone who has battled mental illness for their entire adult life I understand both sides. The problem is we know that it only gets worse and harder to control as we get older and 20 pills a day is a ridiculous amount of medication to be on.Even more disturbing is the fact the psychiatrist who referred this patient has a 48% acceptance rate for euthanasia for her patients when other psychiatrists average 10-30%It's almost as if people wanting to die plan for the least invasive euthanasia route.It's already done pretty heavily in some places.There are times when I worry that the primary purpose of life on this earth is to suffer ("pursuit of happiness" is the opposite viewpoint), and that more money is made by various industrial and medical entities and wealthy investors which seem to intentionally prolong suffering for the sake of their own profit.Why should anyone be forced to live in this current state of humanity? Throw'em in a wood chipper.Agreed. Let's start with you!I think it's more of an allow them to hop into a wood chipper, if that is their choice. [deleted]Good for you and your perfect fucking life. 

[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/78jo02/walgreens_is_now_stocking_narcan_a_drug_that_can/) was removed because title didn't match the article. This is a super important comment from /u/ZigZagSigSag that you need to consider before picking up Narcan/Naloxone:&gt;**IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE NARCAN, PLEASE KNOW THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION**&gt;The full dose of Nalaxone (*Narcan*) can (EDIT: had been "will", few things are constant in medicine) have a fairly abrupt "return" to life. This can sometimes mean the patient is (highly) aggressive when they come to because the high was just stolen out from under them. The good news is that they'll be alive, the somewhat rough news is that they'll be super lively.&gt;Something to keep in mind! Because of the ridiculous fentanyl and carfentanil doses going around and the *extremely* difficult to guage self dosing that users will put into their viens, it is also likely that the first dose or even subsequent doses of Nalaxone won't work.&gt;In some cases, the Nalaxone works for a while, but the drug still present in the system eventually overpowers how the Nalaxone works and the patient will lapse back into their overdose. &gt;Think of the use of nalaxone like you would an epi-pen. If you have to use an epi-pen you have to go to the hospital. Or call EMS, it's medical uber and it's there.

If you have to use narcan, you'd better be calling 911.what is narcan? I honestly cant find anythingA drug that essentially pushes opioids out of their receptors, reversing the effects of an overdose for about an hour. Like an Epi-Pen for narcotic overdose. Oh shit, I watched Louis Theroux's documentary about the heroin epidemic and they were using this on people who OD'ed. Makes them puke and have a really shitty time. I can't remember what they call it, but they have a specific name for the experience. So heroin use is that bad in America huh? Sounds like people need to do a class action lawsuit against big pharma.Heroin really is that bad, especially in the Midwest and south. And a class action suit is a pipe dream in this country. Really bad here in the northeast tooi feel (here in NY) that once doctors had to start electronically prescribing all opiods, it has led to people not being able to get their hands on pills as easily as before and therefore caused a recent increase in heroin use.  Opioid addiction is like a balloon. You squeeze one side and it just enlarges the other. Addicts aren't going to quit because new regulations mean they can't get their pills as easily, they're just going to start using heroin or RCs because it feels the almost the same, is cheaper, and is easier to get. Source: Former heroin addict of 13 years, and only switched from oxycontin to dope once it became easier to get heroin than it was to get oxy. Bad in Canada too. I know people who think they are not addicted to opioid's because the doctor prescribed it! But I am a dangerous drug addict because I smoke weed and that is illegal.The south actually has some of the lowest rates of heroin overdose (3.2 per 100,000) in America. About half as much as the Midwest (6.1) and north east (6.3). It does have the highest rate of increase though.I’m from the south. I don’t understand why they’re trying to cut people off opioids. It makes them go to heroin, and hell now fentanyl.&gt;Sounds like people need to do a class action lawsuit against big pharma.Much more nuanced than that. It's like doing a class action lawsuit against corn farmers and cow breeders because too many people are obese. It pretty much puts you into 500% withdrawal as soon as you're conscious. Like you see the people trying to get clean and how miserable they are. x1000000000&gt;So heroin use is that bad in America huh?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pdPrQFjo2oMy cousin started using again after rehab for the 5th time....:( she is a great cousin but she is probly getting close to that bottom.Sorry to hear that.

I've had my bouts with addiction and it's never easy, not even when you are done with it for a year, relapse can occur so easily if you don't have a good support system, and even then it can be tough.Heroin isn't legal. It's very illegal. What isn't illegal is a whole consortium of pretty much identical, in effect, drugs. And yeah, people love drugs in the US. We've got drugs that can make us fall asleep, drugs that make us happy, drugs that make us numb, drugs that make us get shit done, drugs that just make us want to dance, drugs that give you a big confidence boost, drugs that can keep you awake for days, and all kinds of other drugs all of which can be obtained by prescription with relative ease in many places.Myself, I am on a few pharmaceuticals and it definitely has had a positive impact on my life. Drugs aren't necessarily bad, in fact I believe drugs are good, or at least neutral, as long as they aren't causing any actual problems.It is worse than people like to admit. I personally know 4 or 5 people that have overdosed in the last few weeks and I have been very close myself. It's fucking scary and if narcan is not to expensive I might go pick some up. Louis Theroux's my favorite! I didn't know about the heroin one, watching it now... I watched some heroin docs where if the OD-er is even slightly aware, actively pushing away the Narcan shot since it will waste their high.Withdrawals the words you were looking for are instant withdrawalIt's called precipitated withdrawals. And they are horrible, I had to go to the hospital once, so of course I let them know I went to the methAdobe clinic. It was late at night 12 or so and I had been up since 5, so of course I was tired and fall asleep. Next thing I know I am awoken to the worst WDs in my life, those fucker shot me up with narcan for no reason other then the fact that I was on methadone (only 70mgs daily, so not much for an addict). I was at the hospital for migraines, the precipitated WDs did make the migraine go away though.Hospitals had decades of handing out opiate based pain medications under the lie that they weren't addictive. Then the cost of healthcare skyrocketed and in many cases medical treatment and pharmacuitical treatment are two seperate pay systems in the insurance world, among other factors. So long term pain management patients become hooked on legal pain meds, develop a tolerance, require more pain management, exhaust legal medical access to pain medications, and eventually find out that street heroin is cheaper _and usually easier to access_.There are hundreds of stories about this in the media and nothing is getting addressed about it in the United States and it's depressing.It puts them into immediate acute withdrawal Naloxone, it reverses the effects of narcotics.&gt; What is narcan? I honestly cant find anythingI am skeptical of the word "honestly" here.The plasma half life of naloxone hydrochloride is 60-90 minutes, but if you've had a proper overdose the effects can wear off enough for you to go back under within 5 mins. If you've used it, you definitely need to be calling an ambulance. My service carries enough narcan on each truck to administer 11 doses. And with the increasing amount of fentanyl and derivatives on the market, your local ambulance might not be carrying enough narcan to get you back the first time. Fentanyl has a much higher affinity to your opioid receptors than heroin or morphine, and narcan has a much tougher job bumping it off. I'm a nurse and I thought it wore off much quicker but I haven't given it in years. I had to look it up. Good to know it is indeed shorter.So yeah, if you have to use narcan, you need to call 911.It's just like an epipen. It can keep people breathing for a little bit of extra time for the medical professionals to arrive and deal with it. For both I have heard the max you can really be confident in is 15 minutes.If your friend has an overdose that requires narcan, call for an ambulance immediately. Don't just "keep an eye" on your friend.No.  Call an ambulance.You're right.Yep. Someone OD'd at my parents house (a long story) a few weeks ago and it required 3 Narcan doses to revive them. He was out of the hospital two hours later. &gt;  but I have no health insurance so now I just keep getting bills in the mail.Most hospitals offer charity care and will greatly reduce the amount you owe. Also if you can show that you flat out cannot pay the bill frequently they will drop it or put you on a payment plan that basically amount to a small amount of $ per month for years.Stop doing drugs dumbassWas in the ER recently with my wife. They brought a couple in from the squad that both OD'd the girl came to with one dose. The guy they had to give two doses and when he came back started to attack the nurses. Once they got him settled a short time later sheriff shows up with shackles and cuffs the guy to the bed and tells the girl to leave since she's been discharged or he'll arrest her also. As my wife and I left the girl was outside on the phone bitching cause they ruined her high...&gt; As my wife and I left the girl was outside on the phone bitching cause they ruined her high...This is the start of where we completely fail to address this issue as a whole. Great, you're not going to die now, off you go.Where they will go right back out and get more opiates, sometimes winding right back up in the same ER even hours later OD'd, again. It's a ridiculous cycle until generally they die directly or indirectly.If we're going to bother saving them, then we need to put them involuntarily in treatment. That costs a lot of money, *a lot of money*. Could take months or years and they still may just relapse, but what we're doing now just seems to be a waste of money over the long run. This has crossed my mind so many times, the worst part is that even if there was involuntary treatment, you can only help the people who want to be helped.You could be in one of the 10 states that doesn't have GS laws (afaik, I only looked into it really quick to get something to write here), or maybe because the guy started attacking that crossed some sort of line. From what I read, the GS laws mainly apply to the people helping (the girl in this case), so it could also just be that the sheriff just needed her out of their hair and so he scared her off.I'm in Akron Ohio. There's signs posted all over the ER that if you touch any of the employees in a violent/aggressive manner you'll be charged and arrested. I think it's great my wife is a nurse and I've worked as an EMT for a bit. They are just trying to help and save your life, doesn't matter if your high was ruined or you where just revived from an OD doesn't give you a right to touch the employees there.Oh yeah absolutely. I didn't mean to come off as condoning it, just that in a lot of cases they can also be in pretty extreme pain when the opiates are suddenly ripped out of their system, so they're not always in the clearest mental state. (or to begin with)Jesus Christ. They were probably garbage people before they even started using heroin. No prescription needed in North Carolina.At what pharmacy?http://www.naloxonesaves.org/n-c-pharmacies-that-offer-naloxone/Great thanks!Not sure. The article I read stated there is a "standing prescription order" statewide. It was apparently the third state to do so.Cool, I'll add it to the list!Thank you for this info.And there are a lot of local programs that work in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Durham, and Raleigh that handout naloxone kits for free, complete with clean needles and directions on how to use. It also includes a handout that has all of the related laws should you need to show it to paramedics or law enforcement to prove why you had it on your person legally. There is no law against individuals having it, and the police cannot do anything to you if they find an unused kit on your person, or in your car, they cannot charge you.I have to check out the name of the group that gave me the one I have, it's in my car at the moment and I can't get it right now. But I took a few of these kits when I lived in a bad neighbourhood a couple years ago, and I actually had a gentleman come to my apartment randomly one night at about 3 a.m. to tell me that the kit I had given him had saved one of his cousins lives.It's a terrible issue facing the U.S. right now, and it is unfortunate situation to be in if you suffer from, or know someone that is suffering from addiction. But small things like taking these kits and handing them out, even if people begrudgingly take them, can save somebody, and maybe turn their life around. It's a way you can make a difference if you happen to live in a rough area, the kits are giving out for free, and as for the difference they make, I think saving somebody's life is about as high up as you can get.This is great news.  Does this mean that I can go to any pharmacy on the list and claim one?  I wanted to get two.  One for work and one for home.  Is that possible?  And I wouldnt need a prescription?No prescription needed in Georgia either. Any particular pharmacy or source link?http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2017/03/opioid-epidemic-georgia-overdose-antidote/Was just given a few doses to carry after a seminar done by the wonderful people of Atlanta Harm Reduction. I'll add it to the list thanks!In VA it's available without prescription , but at $135 cost. I called to try and get one for a relative that is struggling with addiction. Sadly $135 isn't affordable to me as a "just in case"  Others have mentioned it's available under medicaid and most third-party insurers. You should definitely look into those options.I will, thank you for the infoBest of luck, to you and your relative. No problem.  Also, from the training I received, the "angry and awake" situation seemed to be much more limited to way higher doses that would be administered once in the hospital.  The woman teaching made note to bring it up, but stressed that the average dose in the field is generally going to wake someone into a groggy and confused state. I have been thankful enough to not need it yet, but have watched a handful of videos that show the same. Ymmv. Luckily it's never something I've had to experience first-hand either. Just going by what the other EMS said.Add Idaho, you do need a prescription, but any prescriber or pharmacist can prescribe it, and it can be prescribed prophylatically and to anyone "in a position to assist a person at risk of experiencing an opiate-related overdose", so friends and family of an opioid user. I don't have a link but it is idaho state statute 54-1733b&gt; idaho state statute 54-1733bThanks I've added it!If you would like assistance in the Boise area getting Narcan, contact Allies Linked for the Prevention of HIV/AIDS or El-Ada Community Action Partnerships. Narcan is Medicaid/Medicare reimbursable, as well as covered under Blue Cross and other private insurers.  Accurate. No one is angrier than someone just awoken with Naloxone.Excellent info, be sure to follow this and the instructions on the packaging.FWIW, EMS had to hit me twice with it before getting me stable enough for transport, then once at the hospital I needed a continuous infusion of Narcan to stay awake (still totally out of it I'm told) So don't think you can give a single dose then let them go back to whatever they were doing. CALL 911.The shit getting cut into heroin nowadays is pure evil. So glad to be done with it.Also no prescription needed in Rhode Island, at any pharmacy. Thank you!Illinois, the home of Walgreens, also has a no-Rx standing order at pharmacies and good Samaritan law in place.[Illinois IDPH page on standing order](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/naloxone)[Brochure on how to identify and use](http://dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/images/Naloxone-Brochure-09052017.pdf) (PDF Warning)[Good Samaritan Law - ILCS 20 ILCS 301/5-23](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=002003010K5-23)On one hand, I am very glad they are doing this.  On the other, I am sad that they need to do this.  This opiod crisis was created by drug companies, and now drug companies are profiting from the fallout.  If you need proof that our government is bought and paid for by big business, then the opiod crisis should be enough...drug companies bribed Washington for profit, and our entire country is suffering for it.  We need to take back our government.  Yeah it's a real sad state we're in. I remember the first time I saw a local pharmacy advertising free naloxone kits and I thought to myself "Wow, I didn't realise [my city name] was turning into such a shithole." Then I realised my entire province was running the program and I felt like I got punched. I'd been reading a lot of news reports about fentanyl and that crazy carfentanyl stuff killing people by that point, but there was that sorta cognitive dissonance about it...I didn't think it was such a widespread problem even though I was seeing more articles every day.I think putting this all on drug companies is a mistakehttps://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/a3z98b/big-pharma-didnt-cause-the-opioid-crisis-most-pain-patients-dont-get-addictedYes, this has been something which has bugged me for a while now, but you aren't allowed to talk about it for whatever reason.    Over the past 20 years or so, I've been to the hospital for some pretty gnarly shit - from a dog attack, to blown ligaments, to having a hole drilled in my skull for a subdural hematoma.  I have gotten lots of pain killers.  I have enjoyed taking them, and I even keep the leftovers and use them recreationally to relax.  Yet I've never felt even a twinge of addiction from them.  I know what a nicotine addiction feels like, and I know what taking daily adderall feels like, and I know what a 6-pack a day during my 20's felt like, and I know what taking Oxy for a month feels like, and of those four things, the Oxy was the easiest to stop.  By a long shot.  It wasn't even really a thing.  And I know tons of people who have the exact same story - they took pain killers and never once thought about heroin.    So then, where are all these "I got addicted after taking hydrocodone for a week" stories coming from?  I mean, I'm sure it happens, but it seems like it is happening so much more than it did even 10 years ago.  I feel like there's some huge elephant in the room here that nobody is talking about.  Obviously it's a huge problem, and I don't meant to trivialize it, but there's something else going on here besides just over-prescription.  When I was 16, they'd give you 30 pills for a broken arm.  So I have a hard time believing that's the cause.  Years ago I was in a serious car accident (drunk driver hit me) that left me with long term back pain.  Taken opiates on/off for years without issue.  Now suddenly I can't get them without taking a drug test agreeing to pill checks ect act.  Sucks to be treated like a junky for necessary medicationThat’s the sad thing in all this. I have a herniated L5S1, plain as day on an MRI. Normally I do pretty good and don’t deal with a lot of pain, but I have my days. I can’t even get 30 to take as needed for those rough days. People who need them can’t even get them now.I know this is not the same, but I was non-functional for a week and a half due to a consistent headache. I had fioricet prescribed and used 30 pills in a year for this set of headaches. I had the hardest time getting a doctor to re-prescribe it for basically debilitating headaches.In the same situation. Have they actually called you in for a pill count?  How did that work?[deleted]I hear youWell if you read the vice article, one idea is that the pills are being diverted from their intended purpose. Most new addicts, the author says, come from people who know or are related to someone with a prescription. This is an interesting take and one that flies in the face of both the liberal and conservative talking points on the issue. Why? Because the common liberal line is that under-regulated and overprescribed pills are causing addiction to spiral out of control. While the conservative mantra is that illegal immigrants are coming over with drug dealers and pushing opioids on the streets, making addiction inescapable. If both of these are wrong, that means that the addiction or need for drugs among certain people existed before anything enabled it. You can extrapolate this further to say that the economic downturn in rural America over the last 10ish years has really caused a lot of despair and hopelessness that people turned to drugs to cope with. And why shouldn't this be true? Instead, like with the black community in the 80s and crack, we choose to say the cause comes from outside. It's people shipping in cocaine or overprescribing pills. We don't solve the real economic crisis in the community that is struggling with addiction, we just pretend that drugs are a self contained issue that needs to be dealt with. I tend to think the answer lies in what you alluded to in your last paragraph. It feels like our country post 9/11 is a lot less hopeful, and has become an increasingly divisive and unhappy nation. This may seem reductive, but the root of addiction and the need to abuse substances is to numb unpleasant feelings. The thing is, how do you quantify this? There's no real way to do a study that shows as the country has become shittier, the desire for escaping has fueled drug addiction. Certainly big Pharma and over prescribing are important factors, but in my opinion they don't fully provide the answer to this problem. 9/11 wasn't necessarily the impetus. The tech bubble burst. Coming through the 90's, the country was producing a whole new landscape of commerce based around the internet. It was a technology based industrial revolution. Million and Billionaires popped up overnight. As the world caught up and the bubble popped, there were suddenly huge gaps.  Additionally, the shift from rural to urban over the past 50 or so years, and the normalization of higher education has not helped.   The American dream is no longer "come to the US and settle into a comfortable, but hard working life that's better than where we were", it's "come here to get educated to get rich". And for the people here, that same mentality of "how to get educated and rich" is the predominant.  Since not everyone can get rich, escapism is not hard to see as a coping mechanism. Don't forget columbine. I remember how that changed high school. Suddenly it was metal detectors and we were suspects.That being said I've gone to school in inner cities my entire life and I've never been through a metal detector other than at sporting events. Graduated in 2013.&gt; That being said I've gone to school in inner cities my entire life and I've never been through a metal detector other than at sporting events. Graduated in 2013.Ha! Metal detectors were in the suburbs.  Also, a semi-suburb (as in, within Dallas city limits, but in a single-family home neighborhood). Fuck, now that I think about it, even my middle school had metal detectors. They also had uniforms (public school) and a requirement that all backpacks be either clear or mesh. I graduated high school in 2004.Yeah, I have been saying this for a while, but America, and to a lesser extent - all of Western Civilization is sort of at a "comfort and prosperity" inflection point.   When times are worse, we end up with something like a natural stress filter.  You simply don't sweat the small stuff when you, eg, need to devote energy to gathering supplies for winter.  Likewise, better times support a forward-looking mentality which helps us to get past little things because we are so certain that the future holds milk and honey.    But now, we seem to be at a point where your average lifestyle is sufficiently comfortable where long-term, existential threats to life and limb aren't really a major stressor.  Meanwhile, the future seems too uncertain to provide us comfort.  So here we are - a people who are just comfortable enough to be truly miserable, is that it feels like.  We have know that addiction is usually about the context in which the pills are taken rather than the biological. Awesome ted talk on it.  However both parties talking points have to be based on the bullshit drug war. Anything that alludes to the drug war being a load of shit cant make on a party platform. &gt; Awesome ted talk on it.  &gt;Any more details on that to help search for it?Edit: another commenter put this:https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong/up-nextAmazing, whether or not it was the same as above commenter saw.Yep! Same one!&gt; So then, where are all these "I got addicted after taking hydrocodone for a week" stories coming from?The media is hyping the most sympathetic stories.  It's much easier to be sympathetic to someone who became addicted to opiates after a car crash, it's harder for people to sympathize with someone who started using because they liked partying with their friends.At first I didn't mind it so much, because those sympathetic stories meant people were finally willing to treat addiction like a disease and get addicts the help they need no matter how they started.  It seemed to be a step in the right direction.But then it became this crusade against "big pharma" and now doctors are scared to death to write prescriptions for pain-pills to people who actually need it.  And meanwhile addicts continue to die in startling numbers, because it doesn't matter that the flow of pills has declined because they're just buying heroin on the street instead.Yes, I know three friends/family members that really really in need of stronger medication and doctors were unwilling so they had to suffer through it on extra strength Tylenol.Repeat after me:&gt; *I must remember that reality is not like me*&gt; *I must remember that reality is not like me*&gt; *I must remember that reality is not like me*Last year, I was prescribed lorazepam for anxiety during my last year of grad school because I was so stressed out. They worked fantastic. I loved how it helped me control my anxiety. I took them as prescribed but even then, after a month, I found myself "addicted" to them in that I could feel my body wanting it. A literal subconscious want for it. Every time I open the medicine cabinet a desire to reach for that now empty bottle.  I swear to god it felt like a warm hug inside me. Now, as I write this, I literally feel a desire for that hug.Pharmacology is way more complicated than it's made out to be. I don't think opioids or any drug for that matter is inherently bad, but I do believe there's a misinformation campaign on the part of the pharmaceutical companies to downplay the dangers and upsell the benefits. I think they also mislead patients into believing that a pain free life is possible, which unfortunately, it isn't.This is a good quick Ted Talk video giving you your answer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY9DcIMGxMsStopping a month after taking them being easy is what makes it so addictive. Attitudes like this allow people to keep taking them recreationally and before you know it you're pawning your shit for two bags of heroin and sharing a needle with your junkie friend because the two of you don't have $3 between you to buy a pack of new ones. That's an extreme example but the stuff is serious. Yeah. Then you do it again. And its no big deal to stop. So you do it again, this time for a bit longer maybe. Quitting is like getting the flu for a few days. No big deal. So you do it again. And now you can't quit.There are certain factors and circumstances that would have predisposed you to becoming addicted and luckily you may just not have those. And not talking about just genes.We're a sick underpaid workforce with no universal healthcare, a modern sedentary life and a disposable economy.  Poverty and mental illness go hand in hand like the creepy twins from the Shining.  I mean, I had tooth surgery once, and was prescribed 7.5mg hydrocodone for a week or two. When the supply ran out, I had absolutely INSANE withdrawal. It was like the worst flu you can imagine. If I had more pills around me at the time, I would have kept taking them to stop the withdrawal feeling. Luckily, I didn't, but I'm just saying, it's pretty easy to get caught in something like thatBecause it all depends on the individual.  There are just folks who are more apt to addiction regardless of what the source is and those who are far less apt to it.  That's why with some people you'll see them quit cold turkey with no help and have no lasting side effects with things like alcohol, pain killers and even smoking.  Granted its not the norm, but I know myself I'm one to not have that addictive personality to things either.Further reading:[Scientific American: Opioid Addiction Is a Huge Problem, but Pain Prescriptions Are Not the Cause](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/opioid-addiction-is-a-huge-problem-but-pain-prescriptions-are-not-the-cause/)&gt; You’ve probably read that 80 percent of heroin users started with prescription medications—and you may have seen billboards that compare giving pain medication to children to giving them heroin. You have probably also heard and seen media stories of people with addiction who blame their problem on medical use.&gt;&gt;But the simple reality is this: According to the large, annually repeated and representative National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 75 percent of all opioid misuse starts with people using medication that wasn’t prescribed for them—obtained from a friend, family member or dealer. &gt;&gt;And 90 percent of all addictions—no matter what the drug—start in the adolescent and young adult years. Typically, young people who misuse prescription opioids are heavy users of alcohol and other drugs. This type of drug use, not medical treatment with opioids, is by far the greatest risk factor for opioid addiction, according to a study by Richard Miech of the University of Michigan and his colleagues.Also at this point we can't even assume that "starting with pills" even necessarily means pharmaceutical-grade drugs.  As the supply of pills on the street has dried up, pill-presses to shape powder heroin into pills has become standard equipment for dealers.  Which also means you can no longer safely assume that pill you were given at a party, doesn't also contain a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl.This article is a steaming pile of shit, sculpted to look like an alibi. From the article, . .&gt; *But while it's clear that this letter was grievously misused by pharmaceutical companies intent on selling opioids—the truth about the real risk of addiction among pain patients and the influence of the now-infamous "Porter and Jick" paper is far more complex.*&gt; . . .&gt; *Yes, the drug companies irresponsibly and reprehensibly misused the legitimate concern that pain was being undertreated to sell massive amounts of product. Yes, Purdue Pharma inaccurately claimed that Oxycontin was a less addictive opioid—and that its effects lasted longer than they really did. Yes, salespeople pressured many doctors into prescribing far more than made sense.*The article then goes on to try to foist responsibility on the addicts. They say that many people had existing addictions and that many of these people were friends and family of  patients with legal prescriptions. But the fact that everyone is concerned about and the point of the lawsuits is this:#***THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS MUCH OF THE DRUGS AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.***Drugs companies raked in massive profits shipping irresponsibly large amounts of drugs out the door and now want anyone else to take the blame. Now, they've realized it's damage control time so they've sent an army of PR drones out to post and promote guerrilla image control like this shit.One good thing: I *will* say I've gained some perspective on the integrity of vice.com.I agree with you. My brother was a heroin addict (and died recently) and never touched a prescription opiate drug in his life prior to heroin addiction. There are further studies that show a good percentage of people who are prescribed opioids never get addicted, at least not in numbers that explain the current epidemic. I know it is easy to find a boogeyman to blame the problems on but to say this is clear proof of something is somewhat silly, and I feel like many redditors have blinders on because they want to feel "right" about something. Certainly an interesting article, but the pharmaceutical industry is at least partially to blame, and the article seems to downplay that. I don't disagree that many people do need prescription opiates for chronic pain issues or long term illness. But these drugs flooded the market because big pharma was pushing them on doctors, influencing politics to avoid regulation, and spending millions on advertising. John Oliver did a fantastic segment to outline the crisis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pdPrQFjo2oThats a good point.  Another good point is that the Taliban completely suppressed poppy production in Afghanistan.  Right up until George W's war over there, which destabilized the Taliban, and allowed poppy production to flourish.  But nobody likes talking about that part of it. There's a lot of research saying this narrative is bullshit. I urge you to take a look.Opioid crisis is as much a factor of the long-time abuse of heroin that has been around for decades and decades. Demand has always been high, it's just that supply is catching up now.Some blame can be assigned to some doctors, but this narrative of putting it 100% on them while completely ignoring the extremely well documented heroine growth is just a dishonest portrayal of what is going on.Not to mention the amount of fentanyl snuggled in from Mexico....I'm just imagining a Mexican dude snuggling a big sack of powdered Fentanyl, in the back of a truck with a big smile on his face.Don't forget doctors overprescribing! You don't need 60 Vicodin after a wisdom teeth removal or 90 Percocet after minor surgery.I don't know what doctors you're talking about the ones here don't give out shit.My dentist prescribed me 8 pills after getting all 4 wisdom teeth out. Probably a huge too problem is that there was a lack of education on possibility of becoming addicted to these substances. 5 years ago I went in for a minor surgery I had never had surgery before and had never taken anything stronger then ibiprophen before. Post sugury I was asked about pain management and I told them that though I have never taken anything strong normally 1-2 Advil was all I needed to get rig of a major headache and that I normally can deal with minor pains and discomfort. They gave me Percocet and never told me of the possibility that I could become addicted or what kind of substances it was. ( I don't even remember the words of it being a opioid like substances being used though I  was kinda out of it) Luckily the high it gave me was uncomfortable and as soon as the tubes were removed I just switched to Advil to deal with the swelling and delt with the rest of the pain. Don't know how it is done now but pain management and education should really be done pre surgery and then revisited again if needed post especially with people who are not familiar with such substances. Edit- spellingI have found with doctors you always need to research on your own anything they give you or tell you to do.  They omit so much information it isn't even funny.  I do not take any pills anymore without researching them myself.  While it is sad this has to be done, all people, at least in the US need to start doing this.&gt;We need to take back our government.  Rather than an endless tug of war over who gets to control everything, what if we just neutered the government from having that kind of control in the first place? It's a double win, make billions while getting rid of a lot of poor people. No one in charge considers any of this a problem, if anything they want to reverse the legal marijuana states because it cuts the profits and efficiency.Like racism and propaganda, just another tool for the wealthy to use against Americans.Tell me again why big pharmaceutical companies want to get rid of poor people?I forget the link of the article but there's one where the drug lobbyists essentially made it nearly impossible for the DEA to come after them for their opiod medication.My university has every single member of security carrying narcan along with the student residence floor managers. Basically every staff member who isn't a professor is carrying narcan. And every 3 feet almost you can see posters titled "recognizing the signs of a fentanyl overdose" its honestly pretty scary but saving lives is really important.It's really unfortunate that it's gotten this bad. Scary too because that carfentanyl stuff is so ridiculously potent the smallest spec could accidentally give a stranger an OD.Supervised injection sites are a really great solution to this. Clean needles and supplies stop the transmission of hepatitis C and HIV. The staff can step in to save somebody's life if they OD and security prevents them from causing too much damage while they are high.Another potential solution is to have people who are enrolled in the supervised injection site program have  access to a program that will test their drugs. So an addict comes into the site and can drop off a small sample of whatever drug they are taking and it will be tested for some major impurities and adulterants. Then when the results turn up with the drug containing fentanyl they are provided every opportunity to rat out their dealer in exchange for something.The testing program would cost a fortune of a cheap reagent test for fentanyl cannot be found. But if it is possible to develop a reagent that reacts with fentanyl that would be a lifesaver.How long can you stay and addict and a student? I would assume it was small town US that needed narcane, whereas the students were all on Weed, which I assume the od treatment for is Dominos.Your university sounds funI saw a guy passed out, slow-breathing, pretty dead-looking in the park where a lot of homeless people hang out. I asked the girl if she wanted me to call an ambulance for her friend. She said it's okay because he's not purple anymore.CVS doesn't require a prescription for this.  Pharmacists (at least here in Missouri) have prescribing rights for it via a protocol with a collaborating physician.  It's as simple as asking for it and getting it dispensed!good! it shouldn't need prescription since it's an emergency lifesaving tool. Please also remember that some people may get very aggressive when you revive them for the belief you wasted their buzz and cash.Also remember that after a few minutes of confused and panicked aggression they will likely slip into an OD again, so if you administer it have paramedics on the way.Hell, they think you robbed them, raped them, kidnapped them, the works.  If you're gonna narcan someone, remember to fully record it for your own liability reasons, but also hilarity on Youtube.The article says "without a prescription in 45 states", what five states decided to not let this happen?I'm torn on the whole Narcan issue. I have had far too many bad experiences with junkies to want to save one anymore. My brother-in-law was a hard core junkie. Robbed my house several times, robbed his sisters house, his parents house, if you lived nearby, your house, all to feed his drug habit. When he finally overdosed all I could think was, the World is better of without him. I didn't even bother attending the funeral as I had nothing nice to say about him. My house was robbed 12 times in 12 years by junkies. By the last robbery the only thing left to steal was the toaster and the alarm clock and they were gone. I guess if there is someone you care about, fine. I quit caring a long time ago. I find it hard to care about someone that doesn't care about me or themselves. Im upvoting you because its ok to feel that way given your experience. Lots of people with no experience with junkies are knee jerk judging you.Having junkies/dealers for neighbors is absolute hell. One of my neighbors was renting out a house, and when his son got out of prison he let him move in. The guy immediately started dealing heroin, and property crime and robberies in my neighborhood skyrocketed from all the junkies milling around. Thankfully he went back to prison about 5 months later.I couldn't agree with you more. I think there should absolutely be a limit on how many times someone can receive Narcan. I think many of them count on being revived and are thus far less careful with how much they use. It's easy to take a sympathetic, romanticized view on junkies when you have zero experience with them.  I have had the displeasure of caring for them after heart valve replacement surgery and now taking care of their poor babies as they withdraw. It's very hard to feel sympathy for drug addicts when you see a baby shrieking, shaking, sweating and pooping uncontrollably because the mother decided she wasn't willing to stop getting high. I think most of the people in this thread wouldn't be so quick to defend junkies if they had to spend one month living next door to them.I don't completely disagree with you. I do not think the main problem is drugs, I feel drugs are a symptom of a much larger problem in our society. People aren't happy, whether due to economic conditions, bad parents who did not prepare them for adulthood, some sort or abuse, etc.People are turning to drugs to numb the pain.  You can save them from an OD, get them to go to rehab, and help them to turn their lives around, but as soon as they encounter the conflict that led them to use drugs, they will go right back to using.  Our society is much worse than it appears, we have deep deep issues and I think it's only going to get much worse. i know how you feel, i have an addict in the family as well. after he became addicted it was like he was possessed by an actual demon. he would do anything to get his precious (pills).I’m not torn, let the junkies die.I really wish we had a program with a reasonable success rate to get people off drugs.  I really wish we had adequate mental health care in this country so people wouldn’t need to self medicate.  I’m not heartless.  Junkies suck the soul out of everyone they know, their families, their children, their communities.  If ever there was a useless group of people, it is junkies.  There are a couple comments here about how important it is to save lives.  What lives??  They don’t have lives anymore.  The crime, the abuse, *their children*... fuck Narcan.  Let them get help or let them die.The number one reason I don't want heroin to be legalized is because of all the children who have to grow up with junkie parents. Number two reason is because they turn their neighborhoods into hell on earth.&gt; Let them get help or let them die.    &gt; I’m not heartless.    How lucky everyone here is to live in a time and circumstance that allow us to come together from all over to discuss this issue. Did we choose our parents, upbringing, or time and place of birth?     These people have been dealt a terrible hand; sitting on your perch and advising that addicts reverse their fortunes or die is pretty damn heartless.&gt; These people have been dealt a terrible hand; sitting on your perch and advising that addicts reverse their fortunes or die is pretty damn heartless.Nope. Believe it or not but not all junkies were dealt a bad hand in life.Oh fuck no.I had a shitty life too, I didn’t stick a needle in my arm so I could cope.  I was a family physician in a small town. My dad ran the biz before me, so we knew these families.  I'd *easily* say at least 1/2 the junkies in my office were from good wholesome families.  Troubles, like any family might have, but decent homes full of good opportunities.  Not that "shitty hand" you describe.Not every junkie is from desperate conditions unless you just count normal life as desperate.  When I asked them "why?" There were all types of answers from "bored", "it's fun (usually the young and new)", "why not?", etc.., they literally just chose to start opiates/heroin.  Almost no illness (often a freely chosen illness) was so destructive to families as drugs (specifically opiate and/or meth).  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but I can see how people just wish they'd die off.  (So much theft, lost money, emotional drain.. so much).  Because what?... many (most) just go right back to using again once they're in the ER parking lot. One time a homeless guy tried to stab me, but I don't think we should stop helping the homeless because of it. Addiction isn't as simple as someone doing it to themselves and not caring. It would be much easier to agree with you if it was, but having had experience with many junkies, I do understand where you're coming from. I've also seen enough people rehabilitated that I still have a lot of hope for more successful rehabilitations.I'm with you. I see people blaming others in this thread (doctors, baby boomers, etc) but nobody holding them accountable for doing drugs in the first place. It's a choice. I've lost three people to heroin. They all made the choice. I'm sorry for your loss. I was addicted to opiates when I was 17. I was hit by a car and spent a month in the hospital getting a shot of Demerol every 2 hours. They sent me home with nothing. I was addicted and didn't even know what an addict was back in those days. I went through full blown withdrawal with multiple broken bones, major road rash, skin grafts, bone grafts, rods, pins and plates. It wasn't much fun. I have a great deal of respect/fear for pain meds now. Every case is different, but consider that for a lot of people, it wasn't necessarily a choice (or at least not an informed one). Some people started off by being prescribed to opiates for long periods of time, and that's how they got addicted. Others get addicted when they are teenagers, before they're smart enough to know what they're getting into. Either way, most addicts don't realize how high the risks are until they are already addicted.I downvoted initially, but by the time I got to the end of your post, I really started to empathize with you. I still think saving drug addicts is a good thing, as most of them don't end up doing what your brother was doing to you.Personally I'd downvote me. I'm not happy with it but that's the hell I've been living with. I'm getting old and there are too many people, much younger than me, checking out because they are addicted to something and won't quit. My Aunt was in an oxygen tent in the hospital smoking cigarettes. She would not stop and cursed at the doctors till the end. How do you save someone like that?  Are you sure that most of them don't end up stealing from others? Unless you're fairly well off, heroin addiction isn't cheap.Lazarus party yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeahhhhhhhh!!Calling EMS medical uber. It's a wonder why we get burned out. Answer a question to continue reading the article. Fuck no and fuck your website. And fuck your face while I'm at it.Why don't you just install an ad blocker? I didn't get any popup about answering a question.Oh look, the drug companies found a way to make more money.  From a problem they created.  Who do they think they are, Equifax?  Sweet! Now's the time to start doing heroin I guess.This is really a pretty incredible development. Regardless of your feelings on drug use (of which I do not hold positively myself) there isn't any denying that this is a tool that could saves lives and is so, so important. Here's hoping this positively impacts a lot of people who are struggling. This will definitely save lives, but I also feel like this will encourage opioid abuse. People will know to buy this and have it on hand just in case they do too much. Or maybe they can make marijuana available at Walgreens nationwide so we can have a safe painkiller available.That's not going to negate the need for Narcan. People will still need opioids. True, but I would think it would lessen the need for it. You're already seeing a drop in opiod abuse and OD's in legal states such as Colorado. Walgreens sells cigarettes. Why not marijuana, right?Well, they're certainly trying, or at least in support of it...http://joinappa.com/2017/01/04/walgreens-surprises-medical-cannabis-advocates/Yeah, I wish weed killed that much pain...I also wish it were less like Chinese food where I don't have to have it every 20 minutes to help. R/kratomTake dabs or edibles they last hours. Or even a vape. Love my vapcap. The M is only $50 and is rock solid.Chronic pain and acute pain are different things. It's not a painkiller. It can distract you from minor pain, but in many people it actually makes pain more noticeable. Comparing weed and actual painkillers as drugs is like comparing airplanes and bikes because they're both vehicles. There's entirely different processes going on in your brain. &gt;Or maybe they can make marijuana available at Walgreens nationwide so we can have a safe painkiller available.There are tons of safe painkillers that work just as well as marijuana. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc.I was thinking this was stuffy nose nasal spray and was super confused for a second...If you ever have any doubts about the effects of race at every level of the US criminal justice system, just remember that when [the CIA funneled crack into the inner city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Alliance) the response was to get "tough on crime" and raise jail sentences astronomically. When whites are hit with a heroin epidemic, the response is to sell the OD medicine at Walgreens.It's disgusting. And this fact is still denied by every day people, who can't seem to see the truth.how is this not already a thing?What a great product, really sad that it needs to exist though. I suspected that allergy meds could treat opioid overdose when I noticed there were poppies in the background of the Xyzal commercial..You know who would really get rich off of making an overdose nasal spray are the same people making the opioid prescription drugs that people are overdosing on.  The Oxys continue to sell briskly.This is also a great time to remind reddit that the Good Samaritan law does not in any way punish you for not helping someone. For whatever bizarre reason every time it's brought up you have a few idiots who insist that you can be prosecuted if you fail to help someone.The reason why this matters is because, no you are **NOT** obligated legally to put yourself in harms way to save another. If you do, that's up to you. Please be safe and don't create multiple victims for first responders to deal with. Offer the assistance and aid you can, in a safe way.Just another fucking drug to mask the problem instead of actually fucking fixing it. It doesn't mask the problem at all. It literally just stops people from dying if they overdose.i understand your frustration at the drug war, i share it as well. narcan isn't a drug in the sense that it alters the function of your body, it simply blocks the receptors that opiates bind to, which stops the effects of the opiates. i agree that this is a bad sign, but this situation actually highlights the problem of the drug war rather than masks it. Seems like a great business model. 1. Make money while creating a problem.2. Make money while managing a problem that you created. It's absolutely genius. Sorry but this is a waste of resources.yes, rather than saving lives why not "save money" by letting them die. I mean cops having to file a report, paramedics getting called anyways if the person is dead/dying, paying a coroner to come out. Let's all "save some money". Even if Narcan is more expensive by a bit, it's not as if its a cost versus free situation, and the result in one case is someone dies who could have lived. They'll just OD over and over again.Why wipe your ass if you are going to just shit again?Following that logic why ever do a bypass surgery on someone over 50 years old? I mean, they're just going to continue having heart problems for the rest of their lives.    I find your suggestion that we should treat humans like dogs rescued from fighting rings pretty disgusting. People are more capable of change than a pitbull that's been abused, and waking up surrounded by cops and paramedics then hauled off to jail is a pretty good way to spur that change.    Plus you have't even addressed the facts at play, its not a "waste of resources" its an adjustment of where those resources go. You haven't demonstrated at all that narcan costs less or more money than the cumulative costs of someone dying. That isn't free at all. The city pays for someone to check they're dead, pick them up, drop them off somewhere else. If they've burned their bridges they might not have family to pay for burial expenses. Etc. And this is all ignoring the obvious, its a matter of whether someone lives or dies, which is a legal and moral responsibility of healthcare workers. Paramedics should be required to save lives without applying their own subjective moral test of who's worth it first. They don't hesitate to save an idiot who crashes his motorcycle, nor someone who's on their 10th DUI. Why exactly should a drug overdose be treated different and do you have any actual proof that Narcan significantly costs more than the cumulative costs of a death? Or did that come straight out of your ass along with your disgusting opinion? Because the 50 year old doesn't keep ripping the bypasses out of his heart?you strike me as the kind of person who's mind is too limited to except any comparisons that aren't perfectly equivalent. In short, someone too stupid to argue with. Good day, ps, you're a bad person. I think this is a terrible decision. The opioid epidemic is just going to continue to growThis is fucking disgusting. Let them die. I bet you're a blast at parties. I bet you're always this cliche in reddit comments.Only most of the time. please i'd rather go out in bliss than live in shitPlease keep in mind that naloxone can be extremely dangerous. It's harmless unless you are addicted to or currently on an opium high or overdose.It will cause immediate acute withdrawal syndrome and respiratory distress (tachybradia) when used on an overdose victim. Be prepared to administer medical assistance until help arrives.It is definitely a life or death treatment and anyone who plans to someday use it needs to educate themselves on administration.
[deleted]They will just start the same tactics again down the road. Throttle, change, throttle, change.[deleted]&gt;If you think Verizon is bad, youve clearly never had any other network. &gt; Trust me, an extra $10 for good service is worth it. And this kids is the future of mobile marketing. Verizon, you need to hire people who are better at their jobs, this guy is way too transparent. I had sprint.  It was tolerable in the newer part of town.  When I moved I was getting 10.1k speeds (I didn't mistype).  I literally would have been better off using a phone modem.  I'm fine with verizons new plan.  Most of time I don't get throttled on the phone at all past 22gb.  The only other carrier around here that had decent service flat ass says they switch you 2g after going over.  Plus I can tether 15gb at high speed.  And feel free to dig into my post history.10.1k speeds? The fuck even is thatI think it means 10.1 kilobits (roughly 1,293 bytes) of data transfer per second. As a reference point, downloading the source code of this page at the time of this posting would take about 306 seconds, just over 5 minutes. Has this been a helpful post? [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/78qckw/verizon_to_stop_throttling_video_if_you_pay_an/dowx2de/) to find out!The fuckGood botFuck that, you can’t compare a serial killer to a simple murderer and say look the murderer isn’t that bad.  They’re both shit. That is why you buy prepaid. Sure you have to buy the phone at or near retail but you don't get suckered into a contract. I have just got a Galaxy 8 with Straight Talk and unlimited talk and text with truly unlimited( normally after 10GB you are throttled) for $55 a month and don't have to worry about being bent over by a contract. Sure I paid $800 for the phone but I use the same phone for 4 years or more.Yeah, but the throttle on Straight Talk is ridiculous. My speeds drop to around 6kb/s after I go over the limit, which is nowhere near 2G. Might depend on the traffic density in your area because most of the time when I was throttled it was about 2G speeds.You mean an extra 10 to use the service you already pay for. Why does the data's origin of use matter?But, you know, according to Pai, there's nobody causing issues with net neutrality. Also, that [these instances violations](https://np.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6cbckk/net_neutrality_john_oliver_vs_reasoncom_whos_right/dhtdwwi/) never happened and are, without a doubt, 100% Grade-A "Fake News."Isn't net neutrality more focused on preventing favoritism towards particular sites? Like Comcast making a deal with Netflix and YouTube for consumers to have better internet speeds with those particular sites whereas Comcast then throttles Hulu and Amazon Prime if you don't pay a premium for them as well?This seems more generalized and could just as easily be a tactic to combat congestion on the network. I'm sure increasing revenue is a factor, but I think that could be looking at it with a very black and white mindset. Idk maybe I'm crazy. Net Neutrality *includes* that, but isn't limited to it.Net Neutrality is about treating all data the same, regardless of source, destination, type, etc. By saying that you can only stream higher quality of videos if you pay more, you're no longer treating it the same as a video of lower quality.If the concerns are about combating congestion, there are significantly better ways to handle this that would work regardless of the data, such as metered traffic (pay for what you use).Your argument doesn't scan - we have net neutrality rules in place currently. Pai wants to get rid of them... Just like the Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism, Net Neutrality isn't about neutral networks. It's a basic framework that doesn't really have power to enforce much. The FCC can just fine people. Verizon has made more money being a monopoly than the fines for it, which I can't google right now, but when enforcement isn't many armed and many toothed, then what is the point?If Verizon is throttling video then they’re obviously not neutral You're reading what I said wrong, and you're interpreting the current rules/regulations wrong. We *have* net neutrality already. What I'm insinuating is it's doing us a world of good in a sarcastic fashion. So, basically, what you're saying is the wild-west times before we had NN can't happen with it in place, but they are according to, well, current events.&gt; What I'm insinuating is it's doing us a world of good in a sarcastic fashion.Why don't you just come out and say what you want to say? You're not even making any sense.If english isn't your first language, I apologize, but I'm not a fan of the popular means of formatting young reddit whipper-snappers use.You mean, clear and concise language?Native English speaker here. You're not making sense. Native English speaker here as well, you're simply bad at communicating your point. The problem isn't our reading comprehension, it's your writing. another native English speaker hereyou don't make sense and you seem like a prickYou're delusional and have said nothing of substance. I'm not young and I've met people with dementia who were better at communicating.Isn’t it an enforcement issue? Verizon and T-Mobile are in clear violation, they’re just not being punished for it. Enforcement is *the* issue, it seems. The FCC even with Wheeler in charge didn't seem to actually *do* much of anything but talk. The FCC has pretty much always been worthless, like the SEC. They can't walk the walk, because they have no legs it seems.If all video is being throttled, then we still have net neutrality.That's not what happened, but you're still wrong.  Putting aside the fact that Verizon doesn't throttle their own cable packages, bundles with phones or other mobile devices, which share the same lines... They're inspecting the packets and reducing the quality based on the type.  That's not neutral to the origin or type. It is a clear end around that is directly against the spirit of the law.  Sure, all data is being treated equally, just not billed equally.  It is basically the same thing in the end.  Doesn't apply to cell networks. We need net neutrality on cell networksYes, that is correct. Because T-Mobile giving out Netflix is bad for consumers? I would just like there to be more competition in all of these markets, wired or wireless. We need more choice. Having two ISPs and two viable cell carriers is lame for everyone, and we all just seem to put up with it in the states. It's baffling. Yeah T-Mobile giving out Netflix is bad for consumers. But not only that, they prioritize Netflix and having it not count against the monthly datacap. So now they artificially create an impediment for another video service to come into the mobile scene. With special agreements like this you will see LESS competition. &gt; Because T-Mobile giving out Netflix is bad for consumers?Yes.  Because now any competition has to overcome even another impediment just to compete on a basic level.&gt; when enforcement isn't many armed and many toothed, then what is the point?The solution to this is *not* to do away with the rules entirely, but to give the enforcement the teeth it needs to prevent the violations from happening.The FCC has literally always been toothless. All they could do was slap a small fine for the Janet Jackson incident, and all they'll do here is slap a fine. What enforcement would they have? ATF level? Or SEC level? Because I'm not really comfortable with either. There isn't a clean solution to this other than having the FCC redefine "competition," which would allow for more providers in an area to come in and say "guess what? We don't do this crappy practice" and make these guys change their business model. Competition is a helluva drug.Make the fines really high. A few hundred million and them having to give areas they throttled free access for a few months. Might make them think again. Don't go "Well fines aren't working, lets stop the rules completely and let them do what ever they want to do".I'd like to see that, or I'd like to see them get their taxation up'd as a result, or perhaps jail time for the CEOs/executives that authorize this crap.&gt;Verizon has made more money being a *monopoly*I don't think that word means what you think it meansThere are circumstances where they did not have competition, and "sole ownership of a market" would be a monopoly, so yea, It does. Don't be a jerk.Please cite where VZW has "sole ownership of a market."  I'm guessing you can't because of AT&amp;T, Sprint, MetroPCS, and TMo.  We'll be waiting right here&gt; Your argument doesn't scanThat's because it's a linguistic expression, not a bar code. If the maintainer of the bot I replied to reads this response, please do some upgrades to the logic circuits.It's a phrase, look it up and stop being a jerk to people in comments, it doesn't make people like you if you're right, because you're still a jerk."But if you pay $20 we'll give you the extra premium non-throttled speed." The next price hike"I'm sorry, since the time you've purchased the unthrottled speed, every other customer has purchased the same package, causing our infrastructure to be overloaded. But for another measly $10 a month we can upgrade you to the extra special premium unthrottled* package"Gah you folk.  Gotta remember to change the last digit so as to identify which deal they got.  Premium same deal gotta be 10.07Gotta make it different enough so as to make it look like they aren't selling you the same service multiple times.For an extra $50 we'll offer unlimited data! Data caps and throttling still apply. **Tax revenue in the billions already paid for U.S. nationwide broadband.***Where Is It?*6 billion for rural broadband during Obama, where the fuck did that money go ?What has it got in its pocketses? I don't get how this works.  Did we just give them money up front to do the job and say "we trust you"?  Who does that?  Isn't there usually a contract and you make progress payments based on the work that's been done to date?Rural midwesterner here... My parents have better internet than me and they live in a town with &lt; 300 people, they have fiber. I live in a city and am stuck with shitty DSL and Cable. The money went to Podunkville USA where there are more cows than people. It was a great government decision.  Well, most people don't even get the choice between DSL and Cable.I live in what you call "podunkville" USA and pay over 60/mo for 1 mbps/800 kbps internet.Companies have plenty of incentive to have a strong infrastructure inside and near cities. They don't have an incentive to provide internet to rural areas, which it seems this was aimed toward remedying.Putting aside the fact that this probably just went to line the pockets of telecom CEOs.I know quite a few people that only have the option of paying 100/mo (or whatever it is now) for a verizon hotspot.That's just one administration - it's a string of unaccountable scoundrels.Aaaaaaaaand it'sgone.pfffff☁︎ VanishedThat's a nice unlimited plan you have there.  Would be a shame if something happened to it.  For $10 a month more I can "insure" you won't have any problems.I was already running through my thoughts on insure vs. ensure when I realized you used quotes to indicate the pun. Carry on.Even with their highest priced plan and $10/month "HD bullshit" they will still throttle you back to the 90s once you hit the cap.Verizon and Nestlè fuck each otherhow comcast was born?Do you want them to produce a child?Nestlón - One of the 4 Horseman of the Apocalypse"You got your throttling on my draining natural water sources!""You got your draining natural water in my throttling!"Two terrible things that do terrible things together!ELI: Technologically how is an ISP able to throttle video based on resolution?  Is it just really just throttling above a certain bit rate that typically corresponds to a playback resolution?  What if I used a VPN w/ encryption, how would the ISP even know that I’m streaming a video?I am not an expert by any means but given that 99% of high res video comes from a small handful of sites just throttling them by default would be the simplest solution. Then you don't have to do any deeper packet sniffing/profiling.Yeah but if the ISP did that, how would they unthrottle those who paid the extra $10/mo?  To me the simplest answer is that they just throttle all traffic above a certain speed.  [deleted]If the connection between you and your VPN provider, through your ISP, is encrypted, then the ISP can't see what the traffic is. Therefore, the ISP wouldn't know if you were streaming video.They'd probably just throttle you to make sure.The key word in vpn is private. Von cons are encryptedOutgoing vpn traffic is encrypted, goes through ISP encrypted, reaches vpn server, is decrypted with a private key, then traffic is mirrored by the server with a new IP address, sent back to the server, encrypted, sent back to your ISP still encrypted, and hits you where your private key decrypts it. In short, your ISP sees nothing but bandwidth. They can't make sense of the actual requests.China did, the GFW has gotten REALLY good at detecting VPN/shadowsocks traffic. While leaving other forms of traffic (for the most part) intact. ISP`s can get a list of common VPN servers and then simply throttle the living fuck out of them.Well, true. Let's hope this isn't our eventual reality.Don't comment if you don't know what you're talking aboutI imagine a lot of their customers would like to throttle Verizon for their constantly shifting quality of service.  These guys are as bad as airlines with their extras and hidden fees.Or you could, you know, fire Verizon.If only I had that option... yeah, where I live they are the only provider that has decent signal (AT&amp;T barely has any, and all the others are non-existent).I'd love to drop Verizon and switch to something like T Mobile's Unlimited plan (for way cheaper than my Verizon Unlimited Plan), but T Mobile is sketchy signal-wise where I live.Same exact situation for me. I did once. So glad I don't work for them or have them for a carrier anymoreI'm going to call Verizon tomorrow and ask them what my options are for lowering my bill. I'll report tomorrow afternoon.Let me know how this goes please!I was basically told "well you can pay more, its better!" They repeated over and over that they are the best there is and that they couldnt do anything to lower my bill.For 150 i can cancel my contract and move to optimum and save money long term. Im debating it because of how much i hate verizon.I'm actually running behind today I sure hope I can find the time to call them. I'm also going to call my cable company and ask if they have a lower tier internet price I pay 56.99 for cable internet and a modem every month on top of my 70 wireless 4gb bill I've been with Verizon for 13 yearsSo..they won't stop throttling video.  Not a real headline.Wait, aren't they basically admitting to doing something that's illegal?When you have enough money, it is not illegal.This seems like extortion...It is, that's the name of the cellular game. "Beyond Unlimited" Plan. Seriously? Do words mean anything anymore?Greedy fucks ain't they?  Time to seize their assets and disband them.  Nothing would warm my heart more than to throw a selfish CEO and his family out into the cold.   If we could only take it to the days of mussoliniYes, what happened to Mussolini was justice served for the prick he was.  I can't feel too sorry for his wife because she should have married better.

How much do you have to pay to get them to stop being a bunch of lying cunts?&gt; How much do you have to pay to get them to stop being a bunch of lying cunts?They spell it all out in the plan.  Sprint lied to me for years about 4g coming.  And my 3g was doing 10k a second download speeds.  I couldn't even watch youtube.  It was useless.  Don't like verizon, don't use them.That's why I left Sprint and won't ever be back as long as I'm alive and they exist. Sprint fucked me with their 4G lies. They promised me in their store that my phone would be able to take advantage of their 4g "wimax" bullshit in the area their store was located at the time, then stopped building that network shortly after I signed the contract. That plan was in place BEFORE I signed up, and they damned well knew in the store at the time that they were abandoning wimax but still sold me (and probably others) a phone that wasn't even capable of 4g LTE. Then they turned around and denied me an upgrade to a phone capable of LTE. Gotta move that old stock out, amirite? I canceled my entire service with them on the spot when they pulled that little bait and switch. Since it was all I could do to punish them I simply refused to pay the balance owed. THREE YEARS later I got a letter from a collection agency, whereupon I contested it as long as I could, set up a payment plan, and paid it piecemeal.I hope Sprint took a loss in the end. They sure as shit didn't seem to express any particular urgency about it. Well, it still pisses me off years later and I'm *never* forgetting about it.Fuck Sprint. Fuck them and their super shitty customer service right in the ear. Or pay for a high speed vpn atnless of the costAny suggestions??PIA (private internet access) is decent.  I pay $40/year.  Works on desktop and phone.  Isn't that the definition of throttling?And if you pay me a totally one time fee of $500 I won't send your wife those pictures of you and your girlfriend....Aren't monopolies great?OR spend 10$ a month on VPN and dodge the throttling, and increase your privacy from Verizon who is definitely collecting and using your data.  You don't even have to pay for a service.  It's easy enough to just run OpenVPN on your own network and be your own VPN if your intention is just get around throttling.  I do this on my network with a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) so that ads get blocked too.  Netneutrality at its best.Isn't this literally the same nonsense that tool Ajit Pai says won't happen if net neutrality rules are repealed. Well I guess he was right....hasn't even been repealed and its already happening. In other news Verizon will throttle your data usage unless you pay $10 on top of your contract price. Tech thuggery needs to stop! I hate the companies that do this shady crap!I'm not familiar with price gouging laws but someone who may be could answer this for me. Is this an example of it in the U.S. Law?This is my surprised face. No really I’m completely shocked Verizon would do something so abusive of their power as a service provider, obviously in anticipation of net neutrality rules getting tossed by a Pai-led FCC. /sIdiots who let their votes give the current administration power? Take a good long look at the kind of future your idiocy is gonna lead to. One where big corps are pandered to by reps you voted into office. And people like us all get screwed out of increasingly more and more money. Thanks for nothing assholes.Check behind their backs, bet their fingers are crossed Just wait until Net Neutrality is gone. I'm sure they'll do this in a heartbeat to their DSL and FIOS customers.They will also stop throttiling you if you don't use them.Is there a way we can hide the quality of the video from the carrier besides VPN? Can we spoof it in the browser?I'm not sure it would help, but you can try manually setting the size of the packets, to something smaller. I won't go into specifics, but using my phone without VPN, video play back always is sluggish. When I use my VPN on my phone, I set my packets to a smaller size, which has actually increased performance. I haven't seen any issue with 1080p playback over VPN.I'm so glad I jumped ship to Fi. This bullshit is getting ridiculous.Only going to get worse when net neutrality is removed.I switched to sprint for their 1 year of unlimited for free, I just pay 5$ in taxes per line per month. Or stick with Verizon and use a  VPNI have Verizon unlimited plan, grandfathered in. I have not noticed any throttling, I stream Twitch at 1080/60 and see no slow downs. I hit almost 40gb last month and never noticed any throttling. 40gb is nothing. You are most likely not even under there radar. If you started  to become a heavy user then most likely they would start to  throttle you.Verizon would hate me.[This](https://i.imgur.com/oJK1bkg.png) is about what i use every month.,But Verizon usually throttles after ~20GB used I thought.  So anyone over that is under their radar but they just can't throttle a grandfathered unlimited customer but would love to find a way I'm sure.They can.  They simply terminate your plan.  They do this to the heaviest users already.  I have At&amp;t fiber. My internet hits upwards of that each month. You are using 40 GB per month on a fiber line?  Why so little?  I will hit that in one porn watching session using lower quality streams.  You can just forget about tv shows and movies.  I brought down over 500 GB yesterday.  500 GB in a day is not an every an every day thing, but it certainly does happen a few times per month.  40 on mobile, 700-800 on fiber. Between work and class I don’t have the free time to burn through it like I used to.Oh look, another major fucking corporation out to pinch every penny until the eagle screams. This is pure rent collection through the issuance of a childish ultimatum.Just like surcharges, late fees, application fees, bubblegum fees, windshield fees, low balance fees, and all other fucking junkIt's the free market at work, just like when people supported [domain registrars removing sites.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/)Honest, question: at what point do we start putting the blame on the consumer? Yes, someone can leave Verizon, but where would they go? They is very little competition, and in some areas, Verizon is like Comcast, as it is the only company that offers decent performance. I'm tired of this always being blamed on the consumer. These companies have been given billions but pocket the cash, and never upgrade the infrastructure. And yet, magically, collecting more money from people will magically fix the strain on the infrastructure. They try to hide behind their excuses, but I think it's time people start protesting.I'm curious what would happen if everyone decided not to pay their bill for one month, maybe 2 months? &gt; I'm curious what would happen if everyone decided not to pay their bill for one month, maybe 2 months?The consumer's credit would be damaged. Verizon would feel no pain, since it's not realistic for everyone, at once, to stop paying their bills.Net neutrality's removal will only make things worse.Any time you hear someone say "they don't make them like they used to" is admitting to the same situation you describe, by allowing inferior products to be sold without alternative. There is not an option to buy something made "like they used to". The consumer does not have the power. Corporations do. Government and control via profits.&gt; I'm curious what would happen if everyone decided not to pay their bill for one month, maybe 2 months? Ummm, then everyone would have to pay the money owed from the billing cycles previous?  And, depending on the company, take a hit on their credit? Seems obvious to me what would happen.I don't have an issue with this.  I'm a data whore and I know it.  I get 22gb full speed.  15 gb of tethering full speed (600k after).  And a lot of the times they don't throttle me on phone even after I'm over the limit.  Would it be ideal if I could just blast 24/7?  Yes.  However around me the cell network is faster than what I can get for DSL or cable.  If they weren't true unlimited we'd have people torrenting and dragging speeds into the dirt. The are by far in a way the best plan around me.  And it's nice to not have root my damn phone so I can tether.Edit.  Looks like I got some haters.  You know if they let me use only my phone I'm going to run 100gb plus a month through the cell network.  I don't get the hate here.  If you want to pay per gig play per gig.You're not getting down-votes because people disagree with the basic idea of "people who use less should pay less". You're getting down-votes because you see justice in that one area and allow it to eclipse all others. Yes, I believe it would be just for me to pay more than my grandma. Right now, she's essentially subsidizing my crazy internet use. But no, I don't think it's just to prioritize or de-prioritize *certain types of information.*You mentioned pay-per-gig, and if that was the debate I'm sure you'd find a few more people agreeing, because that's treating all information the same. But once we start the slippery process of categorizing the content by type (when fundamentally it's all the same on the level of science), we start to give an extraordinary amount of power to these companies to leverage the type of content people can consume.  So slow down, partner. There are plenty of ways to accomplish the goals that you and a fair society have in common. But take a few more minutes to analyze the plans coming out of Verizon and how they might conflict with the goals of a fair society..&gt; You mentioned pay-per-gig, and if that was the debate I'm sure you'd find a few more people agreeing, because that's treating all information the same.They have pay per gig.  Get it if you want it.  I'd rather they throttle my video after I go over a certain amount.&gt;But once we start the slippery process of categorizing the content by type (when fundamentally it's all the same on the level of science)Me loading this page then typing doesn't use crap compared to watching video.  Streaming uses a mass amount of data.&gt;we start to give an extraordinary amount of power to these companies to leverage the type of content people can consume. I actually am old enough I remember life with a 2400 baud modem.  We some how survived.My point is I have an mostly unlimited plan that allows me tether.  It doesn't slow me down if the network isn't congested and I get 22 gb a month.  I'm very happy with it.My only point is that throttling by "amount" of data is vastly different than throttling by "type". One has huge implications, the other is practical.Your grandmother is not subsidizing your use.  She simply is not using what she paid for.  She is allowing them to sell what she paid for to someone else.  Got 10GBit of capacity?  You can be honest and sell 100 mbit to 100 people.  Or you can do what all these companies do is sell 100 mbit to 500 people and hope not everyone wants to use it at the same time.  Well guess what, everyone wants to use it from 6-9 pm, or whatever.  Many people are not getting that they were made to believe they would get.  As for the pay per gb.  That is simply stupid.  The only thing that maters in internet terms is capacity of network.  It makes no difference if you use 1 mbyte per month of 50 tbyte.  Would I pay more for using a gb at 8 pm than I would for using the same gb at 4 am?  Pay per gb just nails people who use a lot but not necessarily people who cause any issue at all.  It really costs basically nothing to send that gb to you.  The person using 50 gb per month is likely just as much or more of an issue to the network because they are likely using that during peak network times.  I downloaded over 400 GB yesterday, but likely caused less issue than a person who download 10.  Reason being is that I kicked off my download cue at around 11:30 pm, so well past peak time.  Internet is not like electric.  In electric you are paying for capacity of the network, but you also need to pay for the generation cost.  In electric generation you generally can save the fuel for later use.  In internet use you can not save it up for later.  Whatever is not used every second simply vanishes as unused.  I'm all for net neutrality, and against price gouging but honestly. . . are we ever going to get past this bullshit that we need full hd video on our tiny hand-sized screens? As far as I'm concerned, limited video stream resolutions is largely a practical and economical solution to preventing wasted bandwidth usage that doesn't change the end user experience. No one needs to or should pay the extra 10 dollars for uncapped video streams the same reason no one needs to or should pay 100 dollars for gold plated hdmi cables. I don't watch Netflix or YouTube videos on my data. Setting speed tiers is what nearly all internet service providers do.  They have done it since broadband became commercialized. Many ISPs have hard and/or soft data caps.  They just provide another option (they didn't lower existing services).  They are a business and while I would say it's greedy, a business that doesn't look out for their bottom line doesn't stay in business.Setting speed tiers makes sense.  As you purchase more speed they should be marking that off of their system capacity.  They do not.  They sell the same bit of capacity many times over and just hope not everyone uses it at the same time.  Data caps do nothing.  Seriously, nothing.  They simply funnel traffic into congestion points.  "Cant download this movie at 1 am while the network is nearly idle because I need to save my data cap to watch game of thrones at the exact same time as everyone else."  It just causes people to needlessly have to prioritize their usage.  Since many people will prioritize the same way we still get congestion in the same places.  It is stupid all around.  I am glad my home internet provider legally can not cap....for now. 
If you didn’t read, the guy originally was made to wear a tracking device. A judge allowed him to have it removed due to “employment concerns”. They should make that judge pay either the reward or bear the cost if they forfeit the bond. I’d suspect that the bail company would have handled the arrangement different had the tracking device not been part of the plea agreement. The bondsman should have picked him up and delivered him back to jail the instant removal of the tracker was authorized. Again, according to the article, the bondsman wasn’t told the tracker was removed. The bond company is completely outside the court system.  The judge does not owe the bond company anything.  Yes, her decision to remove the tracking device should be reviewed, but it has nothing to do with the bond company.  This is a risk bond companies take and it is entirely up to them to keep track of their client and ensure they make it to their court dates.  And they were keeping up with the client through the tracking device, which again was part of the deal this person had that allowed him to get a bond. And I’m well aware that the bond company sits formally outside of the court system. However bond companies do have an important role in this. It is irresponsible, at best, to take action which alters this company’s relationship with its client and not even inform the company. So I do think the judge owed the bond company that. Now whether she legally owed them that is a different story. But I am not sure if this is too fundamentally different than a bankruptcy judge changing a contract or payment schedule and not informing the lender. The judge has a vested interest in the defendant showing up to court, just as the bonding agent does.  The judge was aware that the tracking device was a condition of bond and should have notified the bonding agent of the change to allow them to re-assess their risk.&gt;  This is a risk bond companies take and it is entirely up to them to keep track of their client and ensure they make it to their court dates. Indeed it is the bonding agent's responsibility.  However, when someone actively interferes with that responsibility as the judge did, then that interfering person gains liability for the failure of the bonding agent.This was in Austin, TX. Place last seen: Austin, TX. Travis County.He was arrested in Mississippi after a standoff in 2015. Transferred to Austin, TX shortly after. Then bonded out in 2016. Ankle monitor removed in 2017.

If you have a disability you can get a card for free access to national parks. About 20% of Americans are disabled.If this goes through, which would be an absolute shame, it's going to be interesting to see how far attendance drops. You shouldn't have to pay an entrance fee to see a fucking public national park.Drive down attendance, claim its unsustainable or something equally contrived as justification for selling off tracts of land for commercial exploitation. E - I'm gonna laugh when they start fracking and set off Yellowstone. You beat me to it. Unfortunately due to goldfish memory and 2 week news cycle, everyone will forget how the government started the downfall.Horrible. All thanks to the budget cuts.Which budget cut is this? Trump’s budget hasn’t been passed yet.The proposed budget cuts, just like this is still a proposed increase.https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/fy2018_bib_bh069.pdfThat and the Democrats constantly using the National Park Service to pressure the public during budget fights in Congress. Remeber the government shutdown? They blocked off roads just so they could have news crews recording sobbing parents who tried to take their kids to Yellowstone. I wouldn't doubt this is the exact same kind of sleazy tactics.But...trump is president? And the gop owns the Congress? Who is giving orders for this.if it's a democrat? Is a Trump appointee a closet democrat?You can just sneak in if you know what you're doing. Government employees don't give a shit.Did they even bother asking for a pittance more from GovCo? Of course not, that wouldn't help them along to the goal in mind. Never even been to a national park, and now I probably never will.
Yeah, this person shouldn't be a legislator...and probably not a parent either. I feel sorry for her kid(s). 
  For the most part people in S.W. Virginia own multiple guns and that sweet little old lady in the produce department likely has a .410 derringer in her purse.  Most of them are really good people and would gladly ask you to stay and eat dinner with them.   Convicted felons are not supposed to have guns, but this is one of those areas where the law isn't enforced unless you've truly pissed in the wrong person's bowl of Cheerios. I'm curious as to the back story that isn't being told here.This seems a bit odd.  It is my understanding that the way you get your gun rights restored in Virginia is to petition the court as the start of the process.  The court approves or disapproves it then your petition is escalated to the Governor who may or may not grant it.I've no idea how a law suit gets filed on this issue.  A convicted felon in Virginia loses that right and only regains it with gubernatorial approval, what is there to be sued about?Much is missing in this story. :o(
The offending song was named "Eminem Esque." Kinda lost the lawsuit right there.Did that name actually appear anywhere in the video or in print before the lawsuit? [John Oliver talked about it a bit](https://youtu.be/lCDqHVMzyl8)And yet it apparently took 3 years for a decision to be reached.  I'll admit that I don't understand most legal procedures, but I wonder if experts would agree that taking 3 years to reach this conclusion is pretty absurd.It didn't go to trial until earlier this year. Only around 10% of civil cases go to trial. Most resolve in the settlement phase. Service process takes time, and it's a bit different for international parties than it is in the states. There was also likely attempts at settlement conferences. You also have to serve and depose witnesses, subpoena evidence, etc.Three years isn't that bad. Maybe a bit above average, but most people can expect a year or more for a civil case. I'd expect a little over that for dealing with international issues.[Here is courtroom footage comparing the two songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPcB5IlIILc).Eminem Esque starts at 01:52Paging John Oliver, paging John Oliver......We need another NZ special.He's set to get 413K, that's gonna buy a whole lot of mom's spaghetti.I suspect that $413K is not that much for Eminem. But the point that they can't steal his shit, that counts for something. And not just for him, but every artist everywhere since this precedent is being watched by other countries as well.Ha. Yeah okay, whatever.-China, probablyHa. Yeah okay, whatever.-Every republican who continues to use songs by bands that hate republicans."Born in the USA" is so painfully used as a patriotic anthem when it is clearly anything but.Lol I get a kick out of that being used at political ralliesHell, almost any music they use is by bands that hate themIt's fine.  They only play the chorus.Then when they're elected they implement the rest of the lyrics whether Americans like experiencing them first hand or not.I'm not sure they do that as often as they used to. They got people who like the band to suddenly hate them when the band came out against them. Politicians hate it when their constituents actually listen to someone else, even for an instant. Even china has intellectual property rules. When you can get the offending party into court. A Chinese Communist Local Official who ran afoul of this concept would be an embarrassment and probably wish a $413k fine were all they got instead of a landing in a work camp in NK. lolTell that to the Chinese automotive copycat industry. I highly doubt they'd give two shits if Eminem complained of copyright infringement. &gt; Chinese automotive copycatFor state-backed industrial manufacturers employing hundreds of citizens ... in a country where auto-designs have to be registered with the state directly to get a 25year lockout, that's very different from a singer stealing a song that benefits very few people through employment and isn't an ongoing industrial employer.They fight a lot over those car designs, but in the end it's a state-backed venture. On the other hand: They could fine a singer for the violation and the state would get that money. As long as the singer in question isn't a spokesperson for the state. But if they are working directly for the state, it could be embarrassing for them to plagiarize their content and cause them to fall from grace. So it's hard to say. Maybe Eminem will find out.I'm confused it looks like this guy knows what he is talking about.The complaint would go straight to the trash. The chinese don't give a fuck. Their economy is based on exploiting foreign countries IP.Only if you are Chinese filing the complaint. If you are a foreigner you shouldnt even bother.  i feel your pain - 这是中国，五千年历史，你们老外不懂。I imagine he would use that money for his grandkids(?) education or something. I think he is a grandfather last I checked. That and he does have a pretty special connection to Lose Yourself so I imagine using that song upset him even more.It has nothing to do with money but protecting his copyrighted music.  As if he doesn't then others will use it at will.Which would cost him money through lost earnings. So ... it may be about money. It's all about money. lolHe wasn't involved, just the people who own the song. He likely won't see a dime.Doesn't he have a licensing agreement under which this would certainly fall?I'd like to believe he beat them with a rap battle.He can probably even get a few hot coffee pots. Detroit based Eight Mile Style, the publishing company which holds the copyright to "Lose Yourself," filed suit.He probably will see 0 of that moneyUnless he owns a stake in the publishers.Hopefully he'll donate some of that law cash to help other people.Theres gonna be plenty of vomit afterHere's the kicker, Steven Joyce, prominent National member, said "we think it's pretty legal" when asked about it lol.There was also a debate whether or not Shazam not recognizing the 'Eminem Esque' music was evidence...They actually did a pretty good job of modifying it, but those opening beats and name "Eminem Esque" are a case killer.Also, new sites really need to disable their autoplay when they embed videos.  It is just stupid to have the two things over the top of each other.Exactly. They had it different enough, then did stupid things like the intro, and the name. But for me the real facepalm moment was when they copied the iconic wandering piano line at the end... [deleted]I started the embedded video of the NZ political ad to hear Eminem Esque and the article's video started playing a commercial after it.I guess the real Slim Shady did, in fact, stand upBeen waiting years to make that joke work, haven't you?Some say he's still waiting.Ya but theres a slim shady in all of us. Case closed.How do you sue internationally?You don't. You have to go there and sue within (or hire a lawyer who is there).There are no international copyright laws.&gt;There are no international copyright laws.True. However, to fill that void, there are treaties between countries that entail honoring each other's copyright systems. Except they aren't (as demonstrated by china) *really* the same as honoring each other's copyright systems. They are more along the lines of "honor each other's copyright systems when it's convenient for the state to do so, with built-in exceptions for those otherwise unprofitable rules".is Eminem releasing new songs soon? I miss his music, though I don't want it all rage sounding like it did in past couple of albums. Withoutme was top notch style. it was ok as 8mile too. after that it felt too outraged.It’s looking like he’s going to get pretty political if he does. Judging from his newest song “Campaign Speech” and also his freestyle on BET. It always annoys me that people say that as if he never was political before. Tons of his older songs were political.Yeah. But now he's going after Trump. So people have to act all offended and pretend like he was never that way before.Technically he didn't go after Trump before. He went after Bush. Not saying he’s never been political before, it’s just been his main focus lately. Still a huge Eminem fan, though. 🤘🏼I thought I heard word he's working on a new album?You probably did. From what I've heard it was supposed to be comming out sometime this fall.So are political parties really oblivious to copyright law? Or is this simply a workaround method of selling your music to a political party without *endorsing* that party?Eminem didn't win anything.  fuck headlines like this.  My god.Which doesn't explain very well how he plans to donate his portion of the proceeds to hurricane victims. He didn't start the fight, but he will benefit from it directly. It's just cool that he won't keep that money for himself, but put it to good use.http://variety.com/2017/music/news/eminem-to-donate-lose-yourself-new-zealand-lawsuit-proceeds-to-hurricane-relief-1202599966/So maybe a little less ... indignation?the indignation is for good reason.  I'm sure he will donate the money he gets but I don't suspect it will be much.  First you pay lawyers, then you hope the receiving party finds it in there heart to pay the artist respectably, in an industry that cares very little for its artists.  Not at all saying thats Eminem's relationship with Eight Mile Style.The headline itself leads people to  conclude Eminem was a plaintiff in this case, he was not.  I could just as easily claim "i will give all of the next megabucks win to charity for hurricane relief"  That money still isn't mine, though if the winner does give me some of their winnings, I'd happily follow through.Edit:  Paying lawyers is probably more cost than they won if this is the same case filed in 2014.&gt; I'm sure he will donate the money he gets but I don't suspect it will be much.Those who used his work PAID that money. Regardless of how much he gets, it was over $400k that they had to pay. They felt that loss, and that will discourage others from following in their footsteps. It's a bonus that if he says he'll contribute it that someone else may benefit.&gt; The headline itself leads people to conclude Eminem was a plaintiff in this case, he was not.The headline says he won. He did. Stealing his work is officially theft and in future will be avoided. And now his name is down as "someone who will protect his intellectual property" regardless of who pulls the trigger through what corporate pathway.&gt; I could just as easily claim "i will give all of the next megabucks win to charity for hurricane relief" That money still isn't mine, though if the winner does give me some of their winnings, I'd happily follow through.This isn't about imaginary money. Over $400k will change hands. How much will go to whom is the debate. But those who lost PAID $400k. This is a strawman argument and beneath you. I thought.I mean the megabucks isnt imaginary and I have as much right to it as he does to the companies winnings, but I wont argue further haha.All I'm saying is they coulda have done way better in titling, and reporting this for  what it is, its great international case law, setting a potential precedent that gets rid of trolls in the industry, including Vanilla Ice type folks.  &gt;  the megabucks isnt imaginary Your winnings from it are. You have no rights to it. The ticket says on its face that it has no value unless you win. Disingenuous much?Not putting the main character in the title would be misleading. It is the correct title.Not to sound like a jerk but aren't there such things as jurisdictional boundaries?Certainly. But there are international agreements that allow certain rules to be followed across them. Intellectual properties fall into one of these agreements for most nations.If so, then how can China get away with it? Look at their new fighter jet. It was obviously stolen from the US design.To quote Tosh,  "I love rap, because now we have people who used to be gangsters and thugs telling us not to illegally download music because its stealing. &lt;3 u slim. Not like Stan, a man, a guy without a plan, risking ostensibly, purporting my majesty, coming thru the windows are the whores that I adore. Musical notes from the, people who laid the floor, brothers with attitude, CPT! punk rockers from new York, who perfected Beastie. Its gone on, too long, tl:dr, we love you slim, us fags and all. NZ better pay up.  Lotta things rhyme with kiwi and Maori.If I had Eminem $$ I'd just throw it at a charity.That said, [You wouldn't steal a baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALZZx1xmAzg)The lesson is, just get a license to use the song and if you can't secure one get one for a different song and do a different ad.Wow CNN has the trump bashing "freestyle" right at the very top of the article. Completely unrelated... No agenda here folksLol. He used to be so anti and now he’s just another Corp. He sued a political party u idiot Shouldn’t he have been out on the parking lot flipping them off? He’s so painfully PC anymore I’m waiting for him to start his own political action committee or maybe a charitable foundation to raise awareness of the negative impact of rap music on minority females self image. Hes a grown man, what does flipping off someone from a parking lot do? LmaoSigh. I guess he isn’t the real slim shady anymore.Oh ok, Eminem is a copyright Nazi who doesn't believe in artistic freedom. Fuck him then. lol: it's artistic freedom to directly copy another artist's work now?They made their own version of it.Ah, but this wasn't a cover. They stole the entire presentation and used it for their own nefarious ends. It wasn't "their own version", it was a "look, we did this!" without credit or acknowledgement or payment to the originator of the work. Like copying a book about a brown dog but changing the names and the dog to white and saying "look, I wrote a book about a white dog!"Well to be fair 'they' being the national party of nz didn't. They hired an Australian company to make the ad and take care of sourcing copyright free music etc. Next legal action will now be against that company. Did they play the exact song with eminem's voice beyond a sample?Like I said: They made tiny changes (like names, and colors in my analogy). But presented it as their own. That's what all the testimony was about. The result was that it was too similar to not be theft. IE: Not "their version of it", but "a copy of it".No thank you. I'm for a new era without copyright bullshit. If you sell a product that can be easily duplicated, you should know people are going to copy it, let alone do renditions on it.Your part of an era that is lazy and unoriginal, backpacking off the hard work of others. Be creative. Especially in a field with so much competition. The time has passed where the "art thrives under censorship" excuse makes sense. you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. please stop.I'm not the one peddling copyright bullshit. Do you create things for a living? I do, and it sucks when people blatantly  steal your creations and use their capital to erode your own financial viability. FWIW I appreciate copyright laws. You're the one just trying to steal shit.That'll show him So you don't like movies and books then?Then you can fuck right off. People deserve the right to protect their work.Dumbass boi thinking you can stop piracy with harsh words on the Internet. Anybody who discourages piracy in real life is considered a douchebag. No, anyone that thinks they can just steal stuff is a douchebag. You fucking douchebag.
The hunt for 2.7 billion spent in October. US need some Non Nuke. Smaller Faster, quieter subs. Don't know why you were downvoted, having a larger fleet of smaller diesel AIP (air independent propulsion) subs would be cheaper to operate, cheaper to design/build (there are several AIP designs available to be licensed), and would provide better fleet availability than the current nuke fleet. They are also, on average, quieter than nuke subs, with the leased ones we used in war games kicking the ass of our navy. &gt;For years, the United States has maintained a technological edge over the submarines developed by rival nations, but recent advances made by Russia and China have sparked concerns of an emerging threat to American undersea superiority.Christened earlier this month, the nuclear-powered USS South Dakota marks the US Navy's latest effort to maintain that edge and provides a technological blueprint for future development.Virginia-class submarines currently cost roughly **$2.7 billion** each.Glad to see we still have our priorities straight.If we lost our technological superiority with Russia they might attack us! /sThey won't attack as long as their puppet is running this country.  They already have control.
Another jewel of "Law Enforcement" at work.There's addicts in all professions.Quit defending criminals.Most professions don’t include the power to handcuff people for having drugs and make the drugs “disappear”. Most professions don’t include access to tools to identify drug dealers to rob, or offer protection from anyone ever finding out.An addict accountant is not the same as an addict cop.Curious what tool do cops have to identify drug dealers?Addictive accountant can make your drug habit dollars hidden so nobody finds out so long as you give him drugs too. Who let you on the internet?That’s not even on the same planet as being able to forcefully detain and discredit people you want to take drugs from. I can’t tell if you’re a troll or you really can’t understand why one is much, much worse than the other.Okay, but this is one where it really matters. Police need to protect and serve. Not shoot, and certainly not steal. great job downvoting this comment everyoneI rarely ever defend law enforcement on this website, and I'm not defending the guy's actions of course, but this is like a perfect example of the opiate crisis in our country. That guy was taking the pills, not selling them for cash and being all corrupt and shit. This isn't *the Shield* or whatever. He has a support network and a police union to give him the help. Where’s that help for all the opioid addicts he’s likely incarcerated for the same crime? The opiate crises that was caused by a drug war that this guy willfully signed up to take part in?I'll feel sorry for him once all the rest of the addicts are cared for.He stole more than pills. Weird. I was a hardcore addict of both opiates, and at another time, meth, and I would never do this. In fact, I never stole from anyone and I know quite a few other addicts who never did either.you haven't met many junkies And if the video had fallen into the hands of the police before the public, I bet we never would have heard. [removed]But there's a problem with that suggestion:Do not post material that paints law enforcement in a negative light without a discussion starter (at least a paragraph) within the post or comments.So it’s not worth writing a paragraph about?I'm not really sure what the "discussion" would be about.  Is there a way we can avoid getting caught? Discuss. Is this wrong? Did this officer do a bad thing? Is it theft if the owner is dying anyway, the officer risking his life during a state of emergency? Would it had been better if the officer inventoried the home then had some of the local street thugs come in to clean the place out for a percentage?Yes, breaking and entering (doesn't matter if you had the code or not) and stealing. Too bad there wasn't someone armed in there, woulda/shoulda blown the thief away. Footage wouldn't support the lies they could come up with to try to cover for this thief/thug.Please, feel free to crosspost. I have enough private wars going on in r/politics and r/news.Blue wall.Isn't that kind of in the title?Why? What is there to discuss?He did something immoral, illegal and unethical and has done a disservice to all good officers. He has been charged and arrested. It is now up to the prosecutor to prosecute.What do you want us to do? Do you want me to publicly state that I don't condone stealing drugs and other personal items from a dead person? You should be discussing why so many worthless parasites are allowed to be police officers He bonded out with 2 grand at the very best he may lose his job, as I said Blue Wall. What? Bond amounts aren't set by police officers it's done by the court. If he doesn't get jail times it's a combination of a plead deal and having no prior criminal record. Every time a cop doesn't go to jail people claim blue wall nonsense when there's countless cases of regular people getting no jail time for crimes.He's got the right to pretrial intervention and withhold of adjudication because he's a first timer.Exactly my point but Reddit will just claim it's cause he's a cop. Got to love these armchair court experts.I been in FL. for over half a century the blue wall is a real thing and there is a [oxy epidemic](http://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2016/09/14/fdle-chemist-pleads-drug-theft/90354290/) I took my share. Different standards to be held to, he was in a position of authority.Stop the cops People need to come to terms with the fact that this type of thing happens all the time. Cops are not the "good guys". Not even remotely close. Are there a few cops who are simply good people trying to do the right thing? Yes, absolutely. But they are vastly outnumbered by the bad cops who use the job as a cover for their crimes.Drug addiction is shitty and makes you make shitty choices that lead to you being a shitty person. I'm glad this guy has the support network to get the help he needs. Most addicts aren't so fortunate.I wonder how many addicts he locked up while being an addict himself?I wonder how many people he put in jail while possessing drugs himself. So? He's a piece of shit, I didn't say otherwise.I never stole a fucking thing when I was in the deepest, darkest pit of my addiction. Addiction is not an excuse for moral failings.Same here, and I know a lot of other people who haven't stolen either. There are certain lines some of us just aren't willing to cross; I would never steal from someone, never steal from family, etc. It comes down to character, just blaming it on addiction is easier though.I'm sure you were a fine, upstanding citizen while addicted to drugs.He needs to be thrown in jail, like he's probably done to countless others for the same thing.No shit, nowhere did I say he shouldn't be punished, I was specifically commenting on drug addiction.I'm glad when there are support systems for addicts.But not when time and time again they only seem to get used properly for A) the wealthy (affluenza) and B) Cops and politicians (from the right typically, ones on the left get voted out)This guy and right wing politicians lock up addicts and say they are scum, yet when it's them they want everyone to treat them kindly and with compassion.To disrespect and swerveAdministrative Leave?  How many professions/bosses wouldn't fire you on the spot if they had a video of you doing this in a customers' house?  Am I right in guessing that he won't be fired unless actually convicted of something?  No.  Even then it would have to be something "serious", right?  Bet he's still employed as a LEO a year from now.  None of us would be...There are many people like this in law enforcement. Another reason why we must film them at all times.Some cops call these trophies and think it's perfectly fine to supplement their lows wages in such a way.  They think making 60 to 90 grand a year are low wages.    I wonder what would happen if *everyone* had random drug tests thrust upon them at work. Doctors, nurses, cops, lawyers, judges etc. I don't mean to sound bitchy but I would like others to know the humiliation of having your employer demand you pee in cup, for no reason or suspicion, at random intervals.Unions. They suck, except for the ones protecting the ~~gangs~~ cops, they don't suck. Never hear Washington bitch about them. Teachers unions, yup. Cops unions, fuck you.Even the cops in Florida loot without hesitation.It’s every state not just Florida bud He's just an addict he should receive help not jail time deal, just take his badge and gun permanently though.  No more policing for him in this life.I think he's charged with a felony, so that may come to pass.  While the altruistic side of me agrees, my sense of fairness says he should face the same charges as any other citizen plus an enhancement due to his position of public trust.I can't agree more.  People make mistake but we must hold our police to a higher standard.
How would one go about learning how to work with and develop AI?  get a masters or phd in computer engineeringRidiculously? Ridiculous means laughable, worthy of ridicule, it does not mean 'a large number'....
Used to work for MPD, how they collect this data is crap. It's manual, they even say that in report. Do you know how many things just happen to have dramatic increases when you make an entire police force focus on it?...EVERYTHINGBut beyond that: cops use the non-pursuit policy as an excuse for poor performance, it's a scapegoat created by their captains. I cannot tell you how many meeting with the Chiefs and Captains had: "How do you explain X?" "The non-pursuit policy makes it difficult to catch criminals that do X." And that's outright wrong, after the policy was put in place arrests increased. Police don't come onto a crime scene and see someone physically do the crime then hop in a car and go "well I guess he gets away". Police aren't stupid, some of the management is and I hope this stupidity gets nipped in the butt before people die.Also the MPD has a pursuit policy, if they believe that the persons in the vehicle are dangerous then they can pursue. When we reviewed records for the Chief (still Flynn) most historic pursuits were people with small amounts of drugs or suspended licenses. MPD does solid police work, if you are concerned about crime that's where the money and time goes, not into non-pursuits.And how many criminals who would have been arrested remained free to commit more crimes?  How many innocent people were vicitimized by these criminals remaining on the street?Does the small risk of killing an innocent person in a police pursuit outweigh the future crimes committed by those 2,358 criminals who were not pursued?   Not in my book.The problem of course is that when a pursuit kills someone, you can blame the police for pursuing.  When a criminal is not pursued and commits a future crime (even possibly murder), you can’t link that to the lack of pursuit in the past.   So all we as the public see is the very rare cases where someone is hurt during pursuit - we don’t see the future reduction in harm by taking these criminals off the streets.you'll get a better understanding of the MPD situation from [this article](http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2017/09/07/milwaukee-chief-edward-flynn-offers-changes-pursuit-policy-sati-meet-some-requirements-civilian-boar/639489001/).  Essentially, the MPD are already allowed to pursue if they have probable cause to believe the driver is a violent criminal.  The report in OPs article is strictly focused on outcomes of traffic stops and the primary crime of concern is stolen vehicles.  The primary finding of the report in OPs article is that the systems officers use are not sufficient to support investigative followup on these no-stop cases.  &gt;Does the small risk of killing an innocent person in a police pursuit outweigh the future crimes committed by those 2,358 criminals who were not pursued? Not in my book.Except it's not a small risk, it's a risk every single time the pursuit happens. On top of that, most of these are nonviolent crimes, and it's really not worth risking innocent lives trying to get most of these guys. You're assuming that the people who flee are, for lack of a better term, active criminals - those who are out victimizing people on a regular basis.People may flee because they have a suspended license, or a bench warrant or similar, and pose no unusual risk to the public, whereas a high speed chase most certainly does.Well, out of 2,538 that were not pursued, surely we can agree that it’s likely there were a good number of active criminals in the mix.  How many would go on to commit future crimes?  1,500?  1,000?  Even if it was 500, that is still a ton of future victims.That's also assuming they got away scot-free. If the officer has the licence plate, it's easy to just look up that info and pay the owner a visit at home. Further, police have radios, and can call supporting units in ahead of a fleeing suspect.It's not just the public at large being spared the risk of being killed or crippled by a high speed chase, traffic accidents are also the #1 killer of police officers.And unless they can prove that person was actually the one driving the license plate only does so much. Harder criminals often use stolen cars and such for robberies so the license plate doesn't give you anything. Pretty soon anybody committing any type of serious crime is going to see this as a chance to get out of sight, ditch the car, and disappear to another state.In some cases, yes, it's worth chasing a suspect who has committed a serious crime. But is it really worth it to endanger everyone to chase someone who's fleeing because they don't want to get taken to jail for driving on a suspended license?"More than 5,000 bystanders and passengers have been killed in police car chases since 1979, and tens of thousands more were injured as officers repeatedly pursued drivers at high speeds and in hazardous conditions, often for minor infractions, a USA TODAY analysis shows." [Source.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/30/police-pursuits-fatal-injuries/30187827/)5,000 over the course of more than 30 years among a population of hundreds of millions doesn't sound like a whole lot when you put it into perspective. Also where do you get taken to jail for driving with a suspended license? About a decade ago I had my license suspended for paying a fine late. Didn't know you had to pay a fee to get it reinstated. Drove around for about 8 months before I was pulled over (teenage me wasn't the best driver). I got a ticket and had to hire a lawyer but I just had a friend come pick up my car and then they sent me on my way.Lots of places, actually. I have a couple of friends who had it happen, one of which had a valid license for the state he was in, but it was suspended (unknown to him) in another. One was held until he was in front of a judge and paid his outstanding ticket and reinstatement fee, the other was released on personal recognizance. I imagine it varies by state, and may be officer discretion in many cases.You're right, 5,000 in 30 years doesn't sound like a lot (unless one of them was someone you knew) but there are also the tens of thousands injured, and then the inevitable medical payouts and lawsuits. I just don't see it being worth pursuing someone who fled when they got pulled over for a broken taillight if it results in killing someone's spouse/parent/child/etc.It's not unheard of for serial killers or wanted fugitives to be found when they get pulled over for a tail light being out. If they know they can just flee and the police will assume it must have been a driver with a suspended license they might never be found. Those are probably outliers and I'm actually on the fence about this issue but there are a lot of factors I think people aren't considering.Cities are starting to see the effect of their policies.  Complete lawlessness.  This is equivalent to 26.5 non-pursuits daily.  These aren't people fleeing because they don't have a license.  That time has come and gone.  These are brazen criminals knowing that they will get away with other crimes they are committing because the police won't/can't do anything.  There are many layers to the problem, but when there is no deterrence, lawlessness becomes the norm.That’s what the people want though right? If they are giving people what they want out of their services then I don’t see the problem. 
"Monument Removal Brigade" sounds like a name alt right trolls came up with to try and stir up more racial tensions to detract from ongoing issues.   its common p c language. that rag is conservative as shit. teddy was nothing compared to his cousin.So the name given to people defacing and destroying public property is the issue, not the acts themselves?
So she was planning or already having an affair with  guy from Michigan and she just randomly gets kidnapped? I find it really hard to believe that the two facts aren't related on some level. It seems like was 'dating' multiple men through social media.She was carrying on a long-distance emotional affair via text. That's not really that uncommon. I'm sure the FBI has scoured her phone records, email, FB thoroughly by now. As crazy as her story sounds, I believe it at this point, because I don't have any reason to believe she's *capable* of masterminding and carrying out this kind of plot without a lot of outside help, and there's no reason for multiple people to risk themselves for her. No interviews, no tweets, no book deals, no movie rights... She's kept as low a profile as possible since she showed up emaciated and branded on the side of the road. Actions speak louder than words. She's not looking for attention. The most tragic part is our *need* to believe it's a conspiracy, because the truth- she was mistaken for a teenager and picked up by sex traffickers- is just too *mundane*.Did you ever read up on that dude other reddits call 'slick' just another strange possible angle to a strange case full of strange characters.  Portlandia has nothin on Redding Ca.I've heard nothing about this. Link? There are no credible news outlets reporting on this, it was conjecture on a blog by someone living in the area.  The slick character is real and interesting to boot.People having affairs is common. Also common with people who have affairs is dishonesty, jealousy, deceit, impulsive behaviors, and poor decision making.  I'm not saying she planned to get kidnapped. I'm just saying it's highly unlikely her affairs didn't play a role. Not to mention the circumstances around the kidnapping are suspect as well. No ransom? No sexual assault (that's known) Two Spanish speaking women were the kidnappers? And then they let her go on the side of the highway? &gt;No sexual assault (that's known)...Nobody's under an obligation to provide us with details of their victimization. If she was trafficked, she may not want the whole world to know about it, and until and unless there's a criminal trial, she's able to keep some shred of privacy. The area she lives in has a large Hispanic population, there's a 50/50 chance anyone you encounter there will be Hispanic, whether they're kidnapping you or next to you in traffic. What the fuck are you going on about?  That comment took a nose dive in the second paragraph. Edit:  my bad. I didn’t see the comment above mentioning Spanish speakers.   OopsNo worries. :)&gt; *I'm just saying it's highly unlikely her affairs didn't play a role.*I have seen nothing that indicated she had any emotional involvement with someone else.And EVEN is there was something, your assertion of 'highly unlikely' for the not to have been a connection to someone 2,000 miles away is driven by your own emotional NEED - not logic.And that, my friend is called Projection.I suggest you take an honest evaluation of what is going on in YOUR life at the moment.Ha! Easy, Rod. I think you're taking an internet conversation a little too intensely. Simmer down.Abductor number 2 looks like Danny Trejo. Lol For an article touting new details, there were remarkably few new details to be found here. Official confirmation of Mr Michigan is a giant step forward towards justice.We did get that, but it’s only a vague reference to another man. Weird story.  I want the dirt. Sounds like we will get more information in a week to a month per the sheriff's press release.  I need to order popcorn in bulk for this one.&gt; *For an article touting new details, there were remarkably few new details to be found here.*I have long ben most curious as to the nature and placement of those tattoos, and frankly the manner of how she was bound up when she was released makes me strongly suspect the primary motivation for all this was was a sex crime.3 weeks is a long time for someone to abducted for sex and having no sex.  These rapist are into some serious foreplayIf you call California "Cali", you're not from California. Username is a lie.Lol.  I’m born, raised and still live here in California.   Only us natives get to call it Cali.  Nobody, and I mean nobody, says that. I'd slap you if I heard that.I knew this was the case when i first heard about it, what a preposterous story. I hope they throw the book at her for all of the peoples time and effort she wasted. It never ceases to amaze me how manipulative and selfish some people can be just to satisfy their own desires.No one has claimed to see her during that time period, but they've found DNA from two people on her. Do you think two people are covering for her? How would she motivate them to commit a crime, when there's no clear motive for her to lie in the first place? There are easier ways to con people on GoFundMe than becoming emaciated, chopping your hair off, and *branding* yourself. She said she was abducted by 2 mexican women (race baiting anyone?)  They found dna from a man.  They said they would not disclose the type ofmale DNA.She said she gashed her foot fearlessly smashing a large, hooped earring wearing, chick's head into a commode.  They found no sign of a cut on either foot.&gt;She said she gashed her foot fearlessly smashing a large, hooped earring wearing, chick's head into a commode. They found no sign of a cut on either foot.Where are you getting this information? She's said nothing publicly, and law enforcement is not publishing any details. &gt; *She said she was abducted by 2 mexican women (race baiting anyone?)*And what do you call it when a hispanic DOES commit a crime?Are you suggesting that NEVER happens... in a State where Hispanics outnumber whites?Get serious and quit spouting bull shit. Hispanics are subject to all the same foibles all other humans are.They can be lesbians, and they can be dominant types, and they can be angry at whites.Yes, all that would be unusual, but no less so than for any other race. Again, Hispanics are the majority race in California."The perps were Mexican" "Hey - you clearly made that up for race-bating purposes."Your assertion of the DNA being from a male was not in this article, and other 'facts' you cite were not in this article either.Given the minutae the cops and FBI are keeping close to their chest, I seriously doubt they would reveal if the DNA was from a male.I have a suspicion you have been relying on less-than-reliable sources - the kind that tend to intentionally get people pumped up.Type a coherent comment in reply to the words I said and I'll reply in kind, good day.Edit, sadly I didn't read your whole post, I stopped when you seemed to imply race baiting doesn't exist.   It's not included in the CNN article but CNN is news in the same way I am an NFL quarterback, which is not at all but I can throw a football.http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article180824671.htmlWe both agree all races of humans have the ability to commit heinous acts, yet there is a pattern of white women who have faked crimes to blame minority races.  So if this where a hoax or something else entirely, blaming mexicans would be race baiting imho.
